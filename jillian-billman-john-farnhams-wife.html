Through these years, they have had ups and downs which included financial crises and health challenges.</p><p>After the birth of their sons, the former member of the Little River band experienced what he refers to as his ‘lean years’.</p><p>Billman’s husband had serious financial issues that resulted in him selling their home and all they had. Despite this, Jill as she is fondly called remained with him through those times. The singer admitted that the situation put a strain on their relationship, but it wasn’t bad enough to cause a rift.</p><p>In 2019, Farnham was diagnosed with severe kidney infection after persistent pain made Jill insist he visits the hospital. This diagnosis prompted him to quit smoking and taking alcohol. He also had to cancel his world tour and was confined to recovering at home with his wife and sons.</p><p>As recently as August 2022, John Farnham was again diagnosed with Cancer after swelling in his mouth prevented him from sleeping easily. Jillian once again noticed the pain and insisted that her husband goes to the dentist to check it out. Upon his visit to the dentist, the songwriter was referred to another doctor who discovered that the swell was a <a href=# rel=noopener>cancerous tumor</a> growing in his mouth.</p><p>He underwent a 12-hour surgery with about 26 medical staff on his case and was left in the ICU for weeks. While carrying out the operation, John had a significant part of his jaw removed.</p><p>A <a href=# rel=noopener>website was even created</a> for fans and well wishes to be sent to him.</p><p>Despite all these, Jillian, Robert, and James have been with him. They have given their undivided attention to John’s recovery and were also saddled with the responsibility of updating the public on John Farnham’s health.</p><p>As of February 2023, Jillie’s Song’s singer was transferred into a rehabilitation facility. This shows that his recovery is going well and everyone is still very hopeful that he will be as good as new soon.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kt6q4y6KYp2WSnrmtucCnZKOnmKN6p63Rp5%2BapaNixKqyxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-rawls.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Rawls</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-between-demi-moore-and-mila-kunis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Really Happened Between Demi Moore And Mila Kunis?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
