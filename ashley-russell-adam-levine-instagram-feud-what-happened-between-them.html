Ashley is a 21-year-old college student who runs a health and fitness fanatic.</strong></p><p>Adam Levine is an accomplished singer, songwriter, and musician best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the pop rock band Maroon 5. After starting his musical career in 1994, the California native has garnered insane fame and a fortune of $160 million.</p><p>Adam Levine married Behati Prinsloo, a Namibian model, on 19 July 2014. The couple has two adorable daughters, Dusty Rose Levine and Gio Grace Levine. While the singer is expecting another baby with his beautiful spouse, he faces a cheating scandal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-levine-and-ashley-russell-what-happened-between-them></span>Adam Levine And Ashley Russell: What Happened Between Them?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ashley Russell is a 21-year-old and is from Auburn, Alabama. In an article published by Daily Mail on 21 September 2022, she said that the renowned singer began viewing her Instagram story, liking her posts, and sending her DMs in March this year.</p><p>Russell is a senior-year student at Auburn University who runs a health and exercise account on Instagram with over 7000 followers. As per the fitness fanatic, the Maroon 5 frontman started liking her posts and tried to engage in friendly, flirty conversation.</p><p>The singer often replied to the pictures of Russell working out, particularly those showing off her toned legs and glutes. However, he would delete the messages immediately after she had read them.</p><p>Adam sent flirty texts almost daily, but when Ashley warned him that he would get caught flirting with women online, he stopped. At first, the 21 year-old-girl thought it was weird for such a celebrity to start a conversation with a random college girl, but later felt compelled to continue chatting to see how far he would go.</p><p><strong>Also Read: Is Lawrence Bishnoi Still Alive?

On 20 September 2022, she posted a TikTok video and claimed to have in a lengthy affair before losing touch.</p><p>She also shared screenshots of her alleged conversation with the singer. Stroh also added that she got involved in the affair because she was too young, naive, and easily manipulated. She has also sent some screenshots recklessly to her trusted friends. But one of them tried to sell them.</p><p><strong>Maryka</strong>, a comedian, accused the Begin Again singer of flirting with her in a series of IG stories. The rocker told Maryka he was obsessed with her. When asked aren’t you married? The singer said, yes! But claimed it was complicated.</p><p>Apart from them, the musician’s yoga instructor <strong>Alanna Zabel </strong>and a TikTok user <strong>Alyson Rose&nbsp;</strong>shared a similar experience with Adam Levine.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-levine-cheating-scandal-his-statement></span>Adam Levine Cheating Scandal: His Statement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is hard to believe Adam Levine denied cheating on Behati Prinsloo, with many women claiming the singer’s inappropriate social media behavior with them.</p><p>While denying all the accusations, the Good Mood hitmaker said he used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than Behati in a flirtatious manner. The Maroon frontman said he did not have an affair but crossed the line during the regrettable period of his life.</p><p>Levine continued his family is all he cares about in the world. It would be naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly mattered to him was the greatest mistake he could have ever made.</p><p>Adam Levine’s statement about the cheating scandal came one day after Sumner’s TikTok video went viral. Hopefully, the singer remains true to his words.</p><p><strong>Also Read: Know More About Stephanie Ruhle</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmjnbmmxYyrrKyrlaG5bq3DmqRmpJWrtq%2BxjKKlrKyRnL%2BiuYyfnK6cXay1osCMoZipqJWjsqV5wZ6rsJ2Vo3q1tMSmZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carin-leon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carin Len Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Children, Music, Albums, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./13-reasons-why-characters-love-dislike.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>13 Reasons Why: 10 Characters We Love (And 5 We Can't Stand)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
