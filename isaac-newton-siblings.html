the fields of science, particularly in the areas of optics, calculus and physics.</p><p>He is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.</p><p>Newton’s work had a profound impact on the development of modern science and his laws of motion and universal gravitation remain fundamental principles in physics to this day.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Siblings></span>Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Newton had three half-siblings from his mother Hannah Ayscough’s second marriage to Reverend Barnabas Smith.</p><p>His older half-sister was named Mary Newton, born around 1645.</p><p>Newton’s younger half-sister was named Hannah Newton, born around 1652.</p><p>His half-brother was named Benjamin Newton, born around 1650.</p><p>After Newton’s father, also named Isaac Newton, died before he was born, his mother remarried Reverend Barnabas Smith.</p><p>This second marriage produced the three half-siblings for young Newton.</p><p>Newton was very close to his half-sister Hannah, who helped care for him during his childhood but he had a more distant relationship with his other half-siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Laws_of_motion></span>Laws of motion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Newton’s First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.</p><p>This tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion is known as inertia.</p><p>Newton’s Second Law, the Law of Force, explains that the acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting on it and the object’s mass.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Whitehall Siblings: The Supportive Siblings Behind the Star</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture_of_Margaret_Oliphant.jpg><p>The force acting on an object is equal to the object’s mass multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).</p><p>This law explains how forces cause objects to accelerate.</p><p>Newton’s Third Law, the Law of Action and Reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p><p>When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first.</p><p>This explains how forces always come in pairs – equal action-reaction force pairs.</p><p>Together, these three fundamental laws describe the relationship between an object, the forces acting on it, and the resulting motion.</p><p>They form the basis of classical mechanics and have broad applications in physics, engineering and our understanding of the physical world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Legacy></span>Legacy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Newton’s groundbreaking contributions span multiple disciplines, with his most notable work revolving around the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation.</p><p>These principles, which form the cornerstone of modern physics, explain both celestial and terrestrial mechanics.</p><p>In addition to his achievements in physics, Newton made significant strides in mathematics by independently developing calculus.</p><p>His studies in optics and the nature of light also left a lasting impact on the scientific community.</p><p>Newton’s legacy extends beyond his specific discoveries; he is credited with revolutionizing the scientific method by emphasizing experimentation, measurement, and meticulous record-keeping.</p><p>This approach, now standard in scientific inquiry, was largely shaped by Newton’s rigorous and systematic approach to research.</p><p>His relentless pursuit of knowledge and his willingness to challenge prevailing beliefs were instrumental in shaping the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment.</p><p>Newton’s work continues to inspire scientists today, serving as the foundation upon which modern scientific exploration is built.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp
