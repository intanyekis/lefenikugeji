The network has given us some of the best content from Jersey Shore, The Hills, Real World, and of course, <strong>Catfish</strong>. The series first aired back in 2012 with <a href=#>Nev Schulman and Max Joseph as the hosts.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The premise of the show was to uncover the mysteries behind online catfishing, helping those who are tied up in relationships with someone they've never met before. The series came about following Nev's encounter being catfished, sparking an interest in creating a show surrounding <a href=#>these wild Catfish moments.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Ever Happened To These 'Catfish' Couples After The Show?</a></span></p><p>Although the show appears to be as real as it gets, there are always a few details that strike us as surprising. With 8 seasons under Nev's belt, it's no shock that there are some <a href=#>things that are true and some fake</a> when it comes to the show. It is reality television afterall!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on September 3, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> MTV's hit series, Catfish has been keeping us entertained since its debut back in 2012. While Max Joseph stepped down following six seasons, original host Nev Schulman and Kamie Crawford have taken over. Throughout the many seasons of the show, fans have always wondered what the behind-the-scenes look like, mainly when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whether the show is fake or not</a>. While the events that transpire are, in fact, true, there's a lot that happens that viewers don't see. From signing waivers, sending participants therapists, all the way to the catfishers actually contacting MTV first, the show has its way of operating pre and post-production. As for fallacies surrounding the show, it's a real reality series!</p><h2 id=true-participants-sign-waivers-before-appearing-on-the-show><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>True: Participants Sign Waivers Before Appearing On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Catfish, like most reality shows, require everyone that appears on their show to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sign waivers before any filming</a> ever takes place. Marshall Eisen MTV's senior vice president of news and docs said to Vulture in part, "We never know 100 percent for sure if the catfish is going to go through with this."</p><h2 id=fake-catfish-is-semi-scripted><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Fake: Catfish Is Semi-Scripted</span></h2><p>Many have questioned the authenticity of the show, and it's easy to see why they would. Some things are too good to be true. Even if sometimes things on the show just don't add up, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catfish is not scripted</a> on Nev or Max's part. It's as real as reality shows get, or at least that's what they want us to believe. The series does use an element of pre-production when it comes to the actual catfish though. While fans think MTV seeks out situations, it's actually the opposite!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=true-mtv-sends-therapists-to-involved-parties-post-production><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>True: MTV Sends Therapists To Involved Parties Post Production</span></h2><p>If you've ever watched Catfish before then you're aware of the intensity and dark turns it takes sometimes. There are a couple of episodes that left us concerned for the person's well-being. According to Vulture, MTV <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">avails a therapist to everyone</a> that appears on the show. Kinda makes sense, as the whole experience has got to be nerve-wracking.</p><h2 id=true-people-try-to-catfish-mtv-just-to-get-on-the-show><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>True: People Try To Catfish MTV Just To Get On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The internet has made it easy to take a peek into the lives of the rich and famous, and for that reason, there are people who'll do anything for 15 minutes of fame... including lying about being Catfished. The show has paved way for some crazies, so it's great MTV has a therapist on hand. Anything for that 15 minutes, right?</p><h2 id=fake-the-relationships-between-catfishers-and-catfished-are-always-romantic><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Fake: The Relationships Between Catfishers And Catfished Are Always Romantic</span></h2><p>MTV has been called out for selling the idea that the relationship between the catfisher and catfishee is always romantic. It goes without saying, but it's a more entertaining narrative that gets more people tuned in. According to Vice, Nev, and Max are thought to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stage the confrontations</a> on the show too. Either way, we will still tune in!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is It Really Like Being On 'Catfish'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=true-max-and-nev-have-known-each-other-for-a-long-time><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>True: Max And Nev Have Known Each Other For A Long Time</span></h2><p>Catfish cybersleuths Max Joseph and Nev Schulman have incredible chemistry and part of the show's allure is the duo's witty banter. They are so great together, it only makes sense Joseph and Schulman are real-life buddies. Despite, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph leaving the show</a> to focus on directing documentaries and movies, the two remain close.</p><h2 id=true-mtv-edits-the-show-however-they-want><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>True: MTV Edits The Show However They Want</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show may be real but some aspects of it definitely seem staged and that's owing to the show's editing. MTV has been called out for manipulating and twisting storylines to make the show more entertaining. That makes many question the credibility of the show but most reality shows do this nevertheless. Considering the editing plays such a major role in the storyline, it's no surprise that there's such a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focus on post-production.</a></p><h2 id=true-the-catfish-usually-contacts-the-show-first><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>True: The Catfish Usually Contacts The Show First</span></h2><p>The premise of the show is that the catfishee contacts Nev and Max asking for help tracking down the elusive person they've been talking to online. However, according to The Sun, it's usually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the catfish that makes contact</a> with the show and not the catfishee. Hmmm, we get why many perceive the show to be scripted!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fake-nev-and-max-solve-the-cases-in-record-time><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Fake: Nev And Max Solve The Cases In Record Time</span></h2><p>Max and Nev researching the catfish is our favorite part of the show. Them following clues and piecing them together in a manner that would put Nancy Drew to shame is entertaining. The show edits it in a manner that makes it seem like it's done in record time but the truth is uncovering the truth requires quite a bit of time.</p><h2 id=true-the-catfish-always-has-a-microphone-on-when-the-crew-arrive><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>True: The Catfish Always Has A Microphone On When The Crew Arrive</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show always makes it seem like Nev and Max's meeting with the catfish is spontaneous and sometimes requires an amount of coaxing, which can't be the case, because the catfish is already miked when the cameras get there. It only makes sense, as viewers have to hear them clearly. While Nev and Max aren't the ones micing them up, the crew gets there beforehand to set everything up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is It Really Like For Nev Schulman To Host 'Catfish'?</a></span></p><h2 id=fake-max-and-nev-are-always-kept-in-the-loop><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fake: Max And Nev Are Always Kept In The Loop</span></h2><p>While the hosts are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kept in the dark</a> regarding the direction each episode is headed in, the producers already know who the catfish and the catfishee are - they signed waivers beforehand and background checks were conducted on them. It goes without saying, Joseph and Schulman are moderately impressive detectives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=true-background-checks-and-psychological-assessments-are-carried-out><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>True: Background Checks And Psychological Assessments Are Carried Out</span></h2><p>A lot goes on behind the scenes before and during the filming of Catfish. While it might seem like random people email the show out the blue, the truth is far from that. As mentioned earlier, all participants sign waivers before appearing on the show. That's not all, MTV carries out background checks and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological assessments</a> on the participants too.</p><h2 id=true-manti-te-39-o-made-the-show-popular><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>True: Manti Te'o Made The Show Popular</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who can forget the episode where New Orleans Saints football player, Manti Te'o was catfished? The nation mourned with Te'o when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the death of his girlfriend</a> was reported. There was no girlfriend, however, and the athlete was catfished. Te'o single-handedly made Catfish popular. There's no such a thing as bad publicity, right?</p><h2 id=true-some-episodes-don-39-t-make-the-final-cut><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>True: Some Episodes Don't Make The Final Cut</span></h2><p>There's no denying that Catfish is entertaining, and every episode takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions or annoys the heck out of you. There has been speculation regarding an episode that only aired once owing to the fact that the catfish filed a lawsuit against MTV and then there's an episode that just wasn't aired after filming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Details About MTV Catfish’s Nev Schulman</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqyWnsCpecOeq5qhnKh6tbTArWSaqpViwbPBxGaYp5xdm66ssY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./crystal-minkoff-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Crystal Minkoff Net Worth How Much Is Crystal Minkoff Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bob-rohrmans-ex-wife-ronda-kay-bio-wiki-age-husband-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bob Rohrmans Ex Wife Ronda Kay Bio, Wiki, Age, Husband</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
