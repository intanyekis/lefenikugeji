She first broke the news of her impending motherhood In May 2018 via her Instagram where she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted a picture</a> of her growing baby bump and wrote, “I am very excited to finally be able to share my special news - I’m going to be a Mama!

In fact, the two worked together in the action-comedy drama Chuck where Strahovski starred as Sarah Walker.

To realize her goals, she began making home movies with her dad’s camera as a teen.</p><p>She later attended Theatre Nepean, an actor-training institute at the University of Western Sydney and made her TV debut in 2004 with a role in Double the Fist.
