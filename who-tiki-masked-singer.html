If our guess is correct, he’s a rock star who was everywhere in the ’90s. Keep reading for our best guess to who Tiki on The Masked Singer could be revealed to be.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a>—also abbreviated as TMS—is Fox’s reality TV singing competition series, in which celebrities compete against each other in performances while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks to conceal their identities. Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess the celebrities’ identities based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from the studio audience is eliminated and takes off their masks to reveal their identities.&nbsp;</p><p>The series, which premiered in 2019, is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The King of the Mask Singer</a> in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> executive producer Craig Plestis told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”</p><p>Plestis also explained how he convinced Fox to greenlight <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> for a first season. “From the get-go, Fox asked how we were going to cast this. They were firm in saying, ‘We’re not going to do the show unless you get unbelievable talent for the show,’” he said. “It has to be recognizable names. When the masks come off, everyone has to recognize that face — or they have to have some huge credibility, either in sports, in entertainment, TV, film, music. Some people were easy to cast. They saw the potential of the show.”</p><p>He continued, “They loved the idea of being behind a mask and no one knowing who they were, and showing off the talent that no one knew that they even had. They got it right away. Some people said no. In the end, we got great names, and all of them are big in their field in one way or another. The stats that we have, between the Grammy winners [and other achievements], is really phenomenal. When we started putting together and looked at all the awards all these people have won, we realized we just don’t have one or two great people; we have 12 great people.”</p><p>But back to Tiki on The Masked Singer Season 10.

His friend, Pineapple, told him that he rubbed people the wrong way, so many people wanted to “rum punch him in the face.” (Week 4)</p><ul><li>Bach has been involved in several controversies. In 1989, he wore a T-shirt that read “AIDS Kills Fags Dead,” a play on the tagline for the brand Raid. “That was really stupid and wrong for me to wear that for one-half hour in my life. What nobody brings up is in 2000, when I was in ‘Jekyll & Hyde,’ and at an auction for Broadway Cares, I donated $12,000 of my own money to fight AIDS,” Bach said of the controversy in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Orlando Weekly</a> in 2003.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>He used to party until 6 a.m., now now that’s the time his alarm goes off to take his kid to school.

Scherzinger’s exit came after she was cast as Norma Desmond in the West End’s revival of the musical Sunset Boulevard in London. In an interview With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in September 2023, Scherzinger confirmed that she would be open to returning to The Masked Singer and would like to be a judge on the series for as long as it runs. “Oh my gosh, I would love to, are you kidding me?” she said. “I love my [Masked Singer] family. And it’s such a great job. Are you kidding? I love it. Yes.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2019, Scherzinger explained why she believed The Masked Singer was so successful. “What’s so special and enduring about the show is that it’s crazy and it’s a bit trippy, but then you have the softer side, where people come on and feel a sense of redemption and a feeling of transformation and growth through this process,” Scherzinger said. “I just love the fact that these contestants feel like the world has judged them [or] feel like the world places a lot of judgment on them, and they want to be able to share who they really are. Not by what they think they are but who they are in their heart.”</p><p>She continued, “When the show came out and I saw how much people were enjoying it and gravitating towards it, I was happy for everyone cause they were the brave ones, the first ones to do it and say, ‘I wanna be a part of this show. I wanna have the courage to share my side of my story.’ So, I hope the contestants are really proud and happy they were a part of the show.”</p><p>McCarthy also confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2023 that she’s open to judging on The Masked Singer for as many seasons as it runs. “I have 30 more seasons in me,” McCarthy said, adding that her job&nbsp; “literally feels like a little bit of a dream.” She continued, “I’m hoping this is a show that can go on and on, like American Idol. [And] why not? There are a lot of celebrities that can sing and are hiding it.”</p><p>Thicke, for his part added, “It’s happened so fast. I can’t believe it, because it’s literally one of my favorite things to do in life, and that I’ve ever done in my career. Coming here with my friends and getting to watch these amazing performances and the craziness and the audience, it is so much fun.” He continued, “And now we have a bigger audience than we’ve ever had before. So it’s really a blessing on top of blessing.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.914691943128><h2><strong>Who’s The Masked Singer host for Season 10?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Masked-Singer-Host.jpg><p>The Masked Singer Season 10 host is Nick Cannon, who has hosted the series since Season 1. Before The Masked Singer, Cannon hosted America’s Got Talent from Seasons 4 to 11.&nbsp;</p><p>Cannon told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newsweek</a> in 2018 about why he wanted to host The Masked Singer. “They take what happens on that set so seriously about not letting the word out because it’s a mystery show. They say, ‘It’s not a who done it, it’s a who sung it,’” he said. “You’re wondering who is behind these elaborate, ridiculous costumes. It’s the fun of the show. Obviously, a lot of these people have amazing voices. Some of these people have horrible voices. The idea [is] you’re trying to guess what celebrity that is. You’ve got a little bit of Dancing with the Stars. You’ve got a little bit of The Voice. You’ve got a little bit of Halloween. It’s truly probably one of the most fun shows I’ve ever been a part of.”</p><p>He also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> in 2020 about how he was hesitant to host another series after leaving America’s Got Talent. “I was really meticulous about what I would want to host again in the space of nonscripted variety since I had done it on the biggest level with AGT. I didn’t want to jump in and host another talent show,” Cannon said. “From the very first day I was on pins and needles hoping that no one falls off the stage in those costumes.” Cannon also confirmed that even he doesn’t know who the celebrities are under the costumes before they’re revealed. “All of the secrecy is so inconvenient. Everyone is kept so separate in their own little areas. I can’t see the talent. They arrive in secret locations,” he said. “It wouldn’t be as much fun if I knew who it was.”</p><p><br>The Masked Singer airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
