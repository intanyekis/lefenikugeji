For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Bynes</a> made headlines when she started to fall from grace, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a> is still struggling to recover from her time in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Tara Reid's descent from America's sweetheart to a tabloid-ridden celebrity is one of the saddest cases. Reid was part of the huge&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Pie</a> franchise at an early part of her career, and was poised for a top spot in Hollywood. Unfortunately, a mixture of bad decisions, substance abuse, and strange choices led her down a dark path which she only now starting to recover from.</p><p><strong>Here's How 44 Year Old Tara Reid Ended Up With A $2 Million Net Worth</strong>:</p><h2 id=all-her-eggs-in-the-sharknado-basket><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>All Her Eggs In The Sharknado Basket</strong></span></h2><p>Following her stint in the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;series, Tara Reid noticed that her film choices were starting to dry up. While at one point she was America's sweetheart, things really fell off for her. Reid told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Mirror</a> that, "At the time of American Pie my career was so high, it was blasting and then it dropped. All of a sudden you go from one extreme to the other." Her next "big series" came when she was cast in the campy&nbsp;Sharknado series, which may be making decent money, but is certainly not great critically for her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-to-party><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Loves To Party</strong></span></h2><p>The main contributor to Tara's downfall in the eye of the public was how often she was captured partying by paparazzi. It seemed that every tabloid across the country was featuring her with a glazed over look and a drink in her hand moving through clubs in Los Angeles. The look was not very flattering, but the partying continued to intensify to the point that it became a sad story to watch.</p><h2 id=marriage-bootcamp-fiasco><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Marriage Bootcamp Fiasco</strong></span></h2><p>While reality shows like&nbsp;Marriage Bootcamp are not really reserved for A-List celebrities in the first place, it is at least an opportunity to garner some screen time for those who are still craving it. However, there is one simple requirement to appear on the show - the celebrities at least have to be married!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Secret To A Happy Marriage, According To These Celebrity Couples</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Tara Reid and her then boyfriend Dean May couldn't satisfy that simple criteria since they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lied about being married</a> to get on the show. While some may think it was a misunderstanding, Reid herself has admitted to fibbing just to get work on the show.</p><h2 id=razzie-nominated-performances><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Razzie Nominated Performances</strong></span></h2><p>While not every career choice for celebrities is the best one, some are just downright deplorable for their resumes. Teen comedies were aplenty in the early 2000s, and not all of them featured great performances. Unfortunately for Tara, she was in her fair share of poor ones following&nbsp;American Pie. Her on-screen relationship with Ashton Kutcher in&nbsp;My Boss' Daughter was particularly panned, and gave Reid her first Golden Raspberry nomination for her work.</p><h2 id=wardrobe-malfunctions><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Wardrobe Malfunctions</strong></span></h2><p>To further add to Tara's reputation in the tabloids, she was frequently featured experiencing wardrobe malfunctions in public. Whether it was leaving a club, or - most infamously - during a red carpet appearance, it seemed that the cameras were always catching her at her most vulnerable. While it was not her fault that this happened, it did not help add to her public image, and furthered people's thoughts that she was slipping further down a hole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez Made A Few Mistakes She Might Regret Today</a></span></p><h2 id=relationship-drama><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Relationship Drama</strong></span></h2><p>Being in a relationship in the public eye cannot be easy for celebrities, which is almost understandable. Unfortunately, Tara Reid has more than one relationship which has ended poorly and caused people to question her choices. Dating all the way back to her relationship with Carson Daly in 2001, the relationship ended publicly and full of nasty words. Since then, there have been a string of choices that left people scratching their heads, including multiple engagements that never turned into marriages.</p><h2 id=pre-flight-disturbances><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Pre-Flight Disturbances</strong></span></h2><p>Even when it does not involve being on camera, it seemed that Tara Reid was making headlines for errors in judgment all the time. It was reported in 2018 that on a flight in New York City, Reid made a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disturbance on the plane</a> which caused her to be removed. Allegedly, the issue surrounded Reid not receiving a window seat, a pillow, and having the person in front of her reclined. While these are normal issues people experience on flights, no everyone gets removed for making a scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=slurred-speech-interview><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Slurred Speech Interview</strong></span></h2><p>When substance abuse is involved, it makes things even more uncomfortable before a celebrity takes the time to get the help they need. Unfortunately for Tara, she was still making public appearances when she was not in a state to do so. During an interview promoting&nbsp;Sharknado 6, she made a&nbsp;Today Extra appearance during which she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slurring her words</a> and looked very disheveled. During a time where fans were already questioning her, this did not help her case.</p><h2 id=wild-on-tara><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>"Wild On Tara"</strong></span></h2><p>At one point, it seemed that Tara was trying to steer into the issues, and created her own show called&nbsp;Wild on Tara where she would visit different party spots in the United States and be filmed. While it was a good strategy on paper, it did not help her career since the show was not only critically panned, but was almost like a car crash. People only watched it to see how far she had fallen, but did not have any positive things to say about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rehab-stints><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Rehab Stints</strong></span></h2><p>Following years of being captured on camera in less-than-optimal conditions, Tara Reid finally did the right thing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">checked herself into rehab</a> for substance abuse. This was certainly a move in the right direction, and finally admitted that she had an issue that required help. However, it has not helped her career since checking in as she has yet to bounce back in the eyes of Hollywood.</p><h2 id=plastic-surgery-addiction><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Plastic Surgery Addiction</strong></span></h2><p>Tara Reid first began making less-than-positive headlines following her first experience with plastic surgery. Reid first showed up to a red carpet and people noticed that her breasts were lopsided, and then her first beach photos exposed that her stomach was very misshapen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why People Think Sandra Bullock Underwent Plastic Surgery</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tara had some bad experiences with plastic surgery, and unfortunately, it was on display for the world to see. Reid told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> that&nbsp;"When I realized it, I cried and begged the photographers not to print it, but it was everywhere … I was on the websites as having the ugliest boobs in the world."</p><h2 id=panned-role-on-scrubs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Panned Role On Scrubs</strong></span></h2><p>Scrubs may be a critically approved show, but not every guest star was a welcome addition. As Danni Sullivan, Tara made some appearances throughout the shows run, but she was not any fan's favorite part of the medical-comedy. Her acting ability did not meet the tone of the show, and she stuck out like a sore thumb. Fans miss the show, but certainly do not miss Reid's involvement.</p><h2 id=illegal-marriage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Illegal Marriage</strong></span></h2><p>Things continued to get stranger for Reid, which has made it a struggle for her to find her footing again in Hollywood. While some relationship drama is almost mandatory for celebrities, her "fake marriage" certainly goes above and beyond. When it was reported that Reid had engaged and married Zachary Kehayov in the span of a day, people were concerned. However, it was eventually revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the marriage was not actually legal</a>, and they were not planning on continuing the relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everyone’s Favorite 2000s Female Pop Stars: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhrbWWpmq6zec6lm2askaeubr7Eoptmal2itq24yKilZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-amadou-onana-related-to-andre-onana-family-and-net-worth-difference.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Amadou Onana Related To Andre Onana?
