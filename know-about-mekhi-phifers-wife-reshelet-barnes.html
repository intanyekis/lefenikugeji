Mekhi Phifer is a well-known American actor best known for his roles in the movies “8 Mile” and the television series “ER.” Mekhi’s personal life makes news waves outside of acting. The public is continually interested in finding out more about the actor’s personal relationships and lives.<br></strong></p><p>Mekhi married Melinda Williams for four years before moving on to Reshelet. The couple wed in 2013, and it was a happy, loving union. We’ll go over some shocking facts about Reshelet that you probably didn’t know to address some of the many mysteries surrounding her.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Reshelet_Barnes_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Reshelet Barnes? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Reshelet is currently employed by NBC as a creative director, as was already mentioned. Being a sizable media corporation, NBC must pay well.</p><p>Reshelet’s monthly salary was<strong> $7,545</strong> when Mekhi declared bankruptcy in 2014, according to ABC News, so it must have increased dramatically since then. Based on what we know, Reshelet Barnes’s net worth must be rather large.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_the_twin_brother_of_Mekhi_Phifer>What happened to the twin brother of Mekhi Phifer?</span></h2><p>The birthdate of Reshelet is still unknown. Reshelt’s birthday is unknown, even though she has been married to Mekhi for almost seven years. Mekhi frequently shares photos of his time with his lovely wife on Instagram, but we have yet to come across any that indicate her birth date. All we can do right now is wait and pray for more details about Reshelet.</p><h2><span id=The_wife_of_Mekhi_Phifer_Reshelet_Phifer_works_as_a_Creative_Director>The wife of Mekhi Phifer, Reshelet Phifer, works as a Creative Director</span></h2><p>Reshelet Barnes is a creative director for the American media and entertainment company NBC. We’ve noticed that most actors and celebrities marry someone who works in their respective fields, therefore it’s odd that she isn’t in the film industry.</p><p>They do, however, have a great deal of affection in common, regardless of their jobs. Seven years into their marriage, they don’t seem to be slowing down. Given his prior terrible relationships, Reshelet is without a doubt Mekhi’s miracle woman.</p><h2><span id=Is_Mekhi_Phifer_Married_Relationship>Is Mekhi Phifer Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>Before being married in Beverly Hills on March 30, 2013, the couple dated for several years. Mekhi and Oni Souratha had a son together in 2007 who was given the name Mekhi Thira Phifer Jr. Although the precise date is unknown, Mekhi was left emotionally shaken by the breakup of his relationship with Oni and found his ideal match in Reshelet.</p><p>In a quick (15 minutes) yet exciting ceremony, Reshelet, and Mekhi were wed in front of about 100 people. The wedding’s visual splendor was praised by many guests and family members.</p><h2><span id=The_family8217s_sole_source_of_money_was_Reshelet>The family’s sole source of money was Reshelet</span></h2><p>Reshelet paid for the fees when Mekhi declared bankruptcy in 2014. Reshelet made $7,545 per month in 2014, as was previously mentioned. According to the file, the family’s expenses came to about $11,000, suggesting that Reshelet was solely responsible for keeping the family afloat.</p><p>This is no longer the case, though, as Mekhi is now actively pursuing his career and making a good living.</p><h2><span id=No_biological_children_exist>No biological children exist</span></h2><p>Barnes and Mekhi have been together for ten years after dating for seven years. However, Omikaye Phifer and Mekhi Thira Phifer Jr., two sons from Mekhi’s previous partnerships, are the only children they have.</p><p>Although we don’t know the real reason behind this, we can assume that they cherish and adore both of their amazing sons equally.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>The most shocking fact is that Reshelet doesn’t use social media. It is unlikely that she uses social media. Maybe it’s to avoid the erroneous assumptions and perceptions that come with being Mekhi Phifer’s wife. To see someone at this time without a social media account, though, is still extremely odd.</p><p>She could also be active on social media under a different name to stay out of periodicals and tabloids.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Chris Gardner&#39;s Son Is His Greatest Source Of Inspiration"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/chris-gardners-son-is-his-greatest-source-of-inspiration/"}{"1":68}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Chris Gardner’s Son Is His Greatest Source Of Inspiration</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Nancy Sykes</a></h3>Nancy Sykes estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
