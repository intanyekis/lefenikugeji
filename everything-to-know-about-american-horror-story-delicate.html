Some were pleased by the addition of Kardashian to the long-running franchise, while others — including past AHS cast members — were upset by the casting choice.</p><p><strong>Patti LuPone</strong>, who appeared in Coven and NYC, <a href=#>questioned Kardashian’s decision</a> to take on an acting role while having so little acting experience. “Excuse me, excuse me, Kim. What are you doing with your life?” LuPone asked during an April appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, adding that she was unhappy about Kardashian taking roles from more established actors.</p><p>Kardashian, for her part, said in May that she’s been <a href=#>taking acting lessons</a>. “It’s a challenge,” she told Variety. “I like to challenge myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-to-Know-About-American-Horror-Story-Delicate-With-Kim-Kardashian-2.jpg><p>While Kardashian has less experience than her costars, AHS is actually not her first time playing someone other than herself. She starred in 2008’s Disaster Movie and has also appeared in Drop Dead Diva and CSI: NY.</p><p>“This project has been months and months in the works, and Kim was ecstatic to finally start filming last month,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in June about Delicate. “This is an experience of a lifetime, and Kim can’t wait for everyone to see the final product.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about <a href=#>American Horror Story: Delicate</a>.</p><h3>What Is Delicate About?</h3><p>The 12th season of AHS is <a href=#>based on <strong>Danielle Valentine</strong>’s novel</a> Delicate Condition, which hit shelves on August 1. The book — light spoilers ahead — follows an actress named Anna Alcott who comes to believe that someone is going to great lengths to stop her from fulfilling her dream of getting pregnant. She eventually does get pregnant but then suffers a miscarriage. Anna, however, doesn’t think she really lost the baby. Is she hallucinating, or is something else going on?</p><h3>Who’s in Delicate?</h3><p>In addition to Kardashian, Delicate stars <a href=#><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a> as main character Anna Alcott. The cast also includes <a href=#><strong>Zachary Quinto</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Matt Czuchry</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong></a>, <strong>Annabelle Dexter-Jones</strong> and <strong>Debra Monk</strong>. <strong>Michaela Jáe Rodriguez</strong>, a veteran of Murphy’s show Pose, will make her AHS debut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-to-Know-About-American-Horror-Story-Delicate-With-Kim-Kardashian-1.jpg><h3>Why Is Delicate Controversial?</h3><p>LuPone wasn’t the only actor to raise objections about Kardashian’s participation in the series. After LuPone spoke out, <a href=#><strong>Sharon Stone</strong></a> shared her thoughts in the comments section of an Instagram post about Kardashian’s casting. “It may not be brain surgery but we do treasure our art. We studied, we suffered, we do suffer for it. Ten thousand hours; it’s a thing,” <a href=#>Stone wrote in April</a>, referencing the idea that 10,000 hours of practice leads to success in a chosen field, popularized by<strong> Malcolm Gladwell</strong>’s 2008 book, Outliers.</p><p>Two months later, critics questioned why AHS was still filming after the Writers Guild of America <a href=#>went on strike</a>. Murphy, for his part, denied a series of viral tweets claiming that AHS crew members were told they would be “blackballed” if they didn’t cross the picket line.</p><h3>When Does Delicate Premiere?</h3><p>Part one of American Horror Story: Delicate premieres on FX Wednesday, September 20, at 10 p.m. ET. New episodes will be available to stream via Hulu the next day. It’s not clear when additional parts will air.</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>What Happens in the Delicate Teaser?</h3><p>An August 21 teaser titled “Nesting” revealed very little about the season except that there will be spiders. The clip features Roberts, Delevingne, and Kardashian alongside a group of women in eerie blonde wigs. At one point, Kardashian’s character appears to be pregnant, but then she turns to the side and reveals her belly is actually a giant spider. In another scene, Roberts is on the run from people crawling on the walls behind her.</p><p><a href=#>A full trailer</a>, released on September 6, finally gave fans a glimpse of Kardashian’s acting abilities. Her character is a friend of Roberts’ Anna, who is struggling to balance her career with her desire to expand her family. “Do you want an Oscar?” Kardashian asks Roberts at one point. “Do you want it as much as a baby?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvnaKuwam1zaBkraddoLuww4yamaitpGKurrHRopqapl2dvLO%2BzqtkrKyfp8ZusMSloJyZpJp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gavin-becker-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gavin Becker Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./erick-morillo-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Erick Morillo Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
