The Oscar winner, George Clooney, can be considered one of the richest men in Hollywood. He was named the highest-paid actor in the world in 2018. However, with a net worth of $500 million, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tender Bar director</a> is not exactly looking for cash. In his interview for his upcoming movie, he discussed that he turned down a whopping $35 million paycheck due to the moral conflict with the contract.</p><p>Academy Award winner, George Clooney, said that he was offered $35 million for one day's work to do an ad for an airline, but after he talked to his wife, Amal, they decided that it was not worth it. Amal, a human rights lawyer, married Clooney in 2014 and what Amal thinks significantly affects Clooney's decision. The airline associated with the $35 million deal was incorporated into a country that sometimes maybe an ally. Still, it is questionable at best, and Clooney thought that if it takes a minute's sleep away from him, the deal is not worth it. However, he thinks that the deal not taken would not hurt his financials since he's already had enough and does not regret his decision one bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>George Clooney Says Trump Family Will 'Forever Be Associated With Insurrection</a></span></p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Clooney talked about many things</a> about his career in the interview, one of which is why he does not star in a lot more movies as he used to. He explained that while he enjoys acting, he enjoys directing more which is why he took the director role for the Amazon Studios' movie The Tender Bar. Generally speaking, there are just a lot of great parts for him as an actor, and since he just turned 60 this summer, he thinks that he needs to slow down on taking too many projects. He had a conversation with him regarding taking in workloads, and they both agreed not to overbook themselves and limit the time spent working. They want to make sure that they get to live their lives as a couple since they are not getting any younger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie The Tender Bar is based on the memoir which J.R. Moehringer wrote. Clooney's latest movie taking the role of a director will star Ben Affleck as a kind-hearted uncle who then became a father figure to a child. The setting of the movie is a 1970s family drama set. The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movie will be released on December 17</a>, and Amazon released the movie to have bona fide family holiday offerings to their audience. Clooney believes that recently, it seems like most of the movies released in the last five years tackle hate, anger, and conflicts. This time around, they want to offer a gentle film for the public.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>George Clooney Faces Legal Battle Over $9.8 Million Wine Estate In Provence</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent UK</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0prvRoJxmm5ykvK%2Bx2GapnqKVmMG0ecBmam5lnZ65rbXOp2Sonpaav26yzqtkmqZdlrG3sdGtoKydnZq7tXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-verlander-salary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Verlander Salary: How Much Does He Earn From His Profession?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooke-smith-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brooke Smith Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
