While the girls have, for the most part, move on from their time together as a girl group, they do occasionally get together to work on projects, like surprise shows and performances, but one confirmed project has yet to get its feet off the ground.</p><h2 id=the-spice-girls-were-the-ultimate-39-90s-girl-group>The Spice Girls Were The Ultimate '90s Girl Group</h2><p>Very few pop girl groups amassed the success and popularity that the Spice Girls were able to achieve during their heyday. It all started with an audition of around 400 girls where Mel B, Mel C, and Victoria, also known as Scary, Sporty, and Posh Spice, were discovered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Victoria Beckham Is The Richest Spice Girl, But How Much Are The Other Members Worth?</a></span></p><p>A secondary audition followed which lead to Geri, or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginger Spice, being added to the group</a>. The four girls along with Michelle Stephenson, the fifth member at the time, were all moved into a home to undergo what is essentially pop star training. It was quickly figured out that Michelle was not a good fit, and eventually, Emma, or Baby Spice, was brought in.</p><p>The five young women clicked instantly and showed a fierce sisterhood and comradery that is now a huge and well-known part of their brand. The <a href=#>Spice Girls empowered young children the world over to believe in themselves</a>, girl power, and friendship through positive messages in their music, and each one had a different personality that appealed to a wide audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spice-girls-wannabe-official-music-video-1-33-screenshot.png><p>Their popularity led them to have a variety of merchandise including stickers, trading cards, dolls, lollipops, clothing, and more along with brand deals, massive cassette tape and CD sales, and incredible stage shows during their tours.</p><h2 id=a-campy-spice-girls-live-action-film-already-exists>A Campy Spice Girls Live Action Film Already Exists</h2><p>One of the most popular things the Spice Girls have done throughout their career is release the incredibly campy but fun Spice World The Movie.

The Spice Girls animated movie was announced in 2019 and has had a hard time finding a director to get it off the ground, with very few details being released about the story, what songs will be featured, or what the animation looks like.</p><p>The film is said to turn the Spice Girls into superheroes, and while fans might be imagining a Powerpuff-like plot, they'll have to continue daydreaming for now. After so many years in what amounts to pre-pre-production, it's unclear if the film will come to fruition, or if the former bandmates are still agreeable to working together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrK3sdFmn5qooJq7prCMraZmq6CesKZ5xqKppatdlruqucCtnJ1lnaTDqrGO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbara-walters-now-in-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbara Walters Last Photo Was Seen Years Ago- Where Is She Now In 2022?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./title-yo-gotti-suing-car-dealership-over-damaged-lambo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yo Gotti Suing Car Dealership Over Damaged Lamborghini</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
