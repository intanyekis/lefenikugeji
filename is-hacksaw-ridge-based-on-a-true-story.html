The movie stars Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss, an American combat medic who refused to use or carry any form of firearm or weapon because he was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian. Doss received the Medal of Honour for valor during the Battle of Okinawa, making him the first conscientious objector to do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/orig_593452_1879bright_wide-2d2a921f5a09172c0a8c7d5e7addd2c0ecb23a05-1024x575.jpg><p>The film was released in the United States on November 4, 2016, by Lionsgate.

Desmond Doss, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian who served as a combat medic in the American Army during World War II, is the subject of the movie. Doss refused to use force or kill people because he was a conscientious objector. Despite this, he volunteered to work as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa, saving the lives of nearly 75 soldiers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/HacksawRidge_MarkRogers-D20-9283.gif><p>The film takes some creative liberties with Doss’s story, but it is largely accurate. For example, the film shows Doss being court-martialed for refusing to carry a weapon, but this did not actually happen. However, the film does accurately portray the challenges that Doss faced as a conscientious objector in the military.</p><p>Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and inspiring film that tells the story of a man who stood up for his beliefs even in the face of great danger.
