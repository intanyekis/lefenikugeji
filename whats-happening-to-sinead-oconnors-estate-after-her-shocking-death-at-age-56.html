Sinead was only 56 when she died. "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad," her family confirmed in a statement. "Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ariana Grande & Dalton Gomez Have A Prenup, But Their Divorce Could Still Get Messy</a></span></p><p>The Irish singer – <a href=#>who had a reported net worth of $1.5 million</a> – leaves behind three children, who stand to inherit her seven-figure fortune.</p><p>Interestingly, the musician opened up before her death about how she wanted her children to handle her affairs when she passes. Sinead seems to have given her family specific instructions for what to do, specifically about ensuring they receive royalties for any of her music that’s released post-humorously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"See, when the artists are dead, they're much more valuable than when they're alive," <a href=#>she said in an interview with PEOPLE.</a> "Tupac has released way more albums since he died than he ever did alive, so it's kind of gross what record companies do."</p><p>"That's why I've always instructed my children since they were very small, 'If your mother drops dead tomorrow, before you called 911, call my accountant and make sure the record companies don't start releasing my records and not telling you where the money is,’” Sinead added.</p><p>Sinead was open about her various physical and mental health problems throughout the years. During her life, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, gallstones, and endometriosis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, the singer underwent a procedure to treat her endometriosis, but Sinead says the outcome took a toll on her mental health.</p><p>"Nobody had explained to me or my family that she’s going to be a crazy bitch because we took her ovaries for no reason,” <a href=#>she previously told The Guardian</a>. “So the children were terrified of me. [I was] angry. Raging. I was furious. I was completely gone."</p><p>However, Sinead’s death appears both untimely and shocking, as reports said the musician was <a href=#>gearing up to release new music</a> as well as go on tour in the near future. It’s possible that new music may still be released after her death, if her family agrees to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Sofia Vergara & Joe Manganiello’s Divorce Gets Complicated As They Fight For Custody Of Their Dog</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Marca</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTEqa3TrGShmaClsq%2B1zaBkraddqLavscCdZKibn6O7sL7SZpysrJGpsm6txa2cq2WYmr9uv8eomqShnpx6pbHArZ9mmaRirqixjG5taA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./faith-evans-stevie-j-finalize-divorce-1234772553.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Faith Evans, Stevie J.
