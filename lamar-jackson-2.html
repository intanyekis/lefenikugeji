When he played football, he was able to score a touchdown with relative ease almost every time.</p><p>His mother, Felicia, was aware of the abilities that her son possessed and was aware that he possessed the potential to become something extraordinary. Marquise Brown was Lamar’s opponent in a game of Pop Warner football played in Florida.</p><p>In high school, he began his academic career at Santaluces Community High School in Lantana, Florida; however, he later transferred to Boynton Beach High School in Boynton Beach, Florida, which is 30 miles away from Santaluces Community High School.

He completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards and an interception while also rushing for 117 yards, setting a Ravens record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game. The Ravens won 24–21.</p><p>Jackson established himself as an important member of the team until the end of the season. The Ravens’ coaching staff decided to abandon the offensive strategy devised for Joe Flacco in favor of a new philosophy centered on Jackson’s specific skills.</p><p>Lamar went 17 of 20 for 324 yards and 5 touchdowns in the first game of the 2019 season against the Miami Dolphins, becoming the youngest quarterback to achieve a perfect passer rating in the 59–10 victory.</p><p>He finished with 236 passing yards and 152 rushing yards against the Cincinnati Bengals.
