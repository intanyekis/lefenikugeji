DeBose explained that her script had no words because the <a href=#>Writers Guild of America is on strike</a>.</p><p>“Our siblings over at the WGA are currently on strike in pursuit of a fair deal,” she said. “Award shows are traditionally written by members of the WGA. In order for this show to go on, a whole host of people had to come together in order to find a compromise. And we are all here, so to every single person who had a hand in finding that compromise, I say a full-throated thank you!”</p><p>The Tony nominee knew that audiences would wonder why this is relevant. “So now you’re asking, what’s the compromise? Well, we <a href=#>don’t have a script</a>, you guys. Yeah, I’m live and unscripted — you’re welcome,” she quipped. “So to anyone who may have thought last year was a bit unhinged, to them I say, ‘Darlings, buckle up.'”</p><p>DeBose continued, “But in all seriousness, yes, I am unscripted as is every presenter who comes on this stage tonight. We’re just making it up as we go along. And that’s cool. Again, it’s a blessing to be here.”</p><p>She added that that the monitors on the sides of the stage will only show a countdown for acceptance speeches that go long. “But honeys, take your moment. Tonight is about you,” DeBose added.</p><p class=p1>The Oscar winner — who got her start performing in Broadway productions of&nbsp;<i>Hamilton</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Bronx Tale&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Summer: A Donna Summer Musical</i>&nbsp;— <a href=#>previously hosted the 2022 ceremony</a>, which was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City last June. During the show, DeBose <a href=#>wowed with a show-stopping medley</a> of Great White Way hits, including “Somewhere” from&nbsp;<a href=#><i>West Side Story</i></a>. (The&nbsp;<i>So You Think You Can Dance&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#>won her first Oscar</a> for her role of Anita in <a href=#><strong>Steven Spielberg</strong></a>’s 2021 remake of the movie musical.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ariana-DeBose-Explains-Why-She-s-Unscripted-at-the-2023-Tony-Awards-in-Opening-Monologue-Darlings-Buckle-Up-318.jpg><p class=p1>It was announced in April that DeBose would host the Tonys — which was <a href=#>moving from Radio City</a> to the United Palace in Washington Heights — for a second year. “I was honored to serve as host last year and even more so to be asked back!” s<a href=#>he said in a statement at the time.</a> “So looking forward to celebrating this incredible season and the people who make the work happen. Here’s to adding some uptown flavor to the magic of&nbsp;the Tony Awards.”</p><p class=p1>DeBose’s emcee gig marks her first live performance since her rap at <a href=#>the 2023 BAFTAs</a> went viral. During the February awards show, the&nbsp;<i>Wish&nbsp;</i>voice actress hosted the ceremony and <a href=#>shouted out all of the female nominees in song</a>, including <a href=#><strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Angela Bassett</strong></a> for doing “the thing.” While social media users quickly criticized DeBose’s musical tone and lyrics, both the actress and the BAFTAs producers <a href=#>defended the show bit</a>. However, getting up on stage on Sunday was still nerve-wracking for the North Carolina native.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Have I developed <a href=#>a little bit of stage fright</a>? I would be lying if I said, ‘no,’” the&nbsp;<i>Prom&nbsp;</i>actress confessed to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Marie Claire</a>&nbsp;</i>earlier this month. “But I also challenge myself and I do scary things every day. And if I’m afraid of something, I should probably do it.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I have found that trying to act as if I don’t feel something is not helpful. Pretending it’s not happening [is] not helpful. Yes, I performed<a href=#> at the BAFTAs</a>. Yes, the Internet had a moment about it. Yes, some things were said that I didn’t appreciate and that I found very hurtful. And yes, eventually the tide turned on the Internet and <a href=#>people found what I saw in it</a>: the fun, the joy. But that doesn’t mean that along that little journey, I didn’t feel my feelings about having the Internet make fun of me for being me and doing what I love to do. I don’t understand that part of society.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiroZGjrm6wxJumrJ1dmsWxuMCipaxlpaPApL7IqauenF2ivK%2B7y6ierp1dlsFufo9ramasn6PGbq3Wmqmdq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-fox-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-112349-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Fox Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adrienne-bailon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adrienne Bailon Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
