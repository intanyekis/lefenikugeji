During that time, she was nominated for an Emmy for best individual performance in a variety program. In the latest offering, Shannon returned to the 'SNL' stage with her character Sally O'Malley, a brazen 50-year-old dancer with a red dress and 70s-style wig. The character made her television debut in 1999 when she tried out for The Rockettes.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'That was cool!': 'Saturday Night Live' fans go gaga over 'Avatar' parody sketch</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Do better': 'Saturday Night Live' slammed for bringing back Dave Chappelle as host after midterm elections</a></p><p>In the skit from April 8, Sally is a recently-recruited dance choreographer for the Jonas Brothers, who are ready to begin a Vegas residency. The Jonas brothers Joe, Kevin, and Nick then appear while sporting identical red pantsuits and perform Sally's famous signature steps like kick, stretch, etc. In the 'SNL' episode, Sally's age hasn't changed in more than 20 years, but Shannon closes this gap by telling Bowen Yang, "Honey, I've been 50 since before you were even born," reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>The actor most recently appeared in 'A Good Person', directed by Zach Braff, which was shown in theaters on March 24. She will also be seen in 'The Other Two' season 3, which returns on HBO Max on May 4.</p><h2 class=split>Shannon's monologue</h2><p>Shannon last served as show host in 2007, but she has since made a few guest appearances. She remarks in her monologue about her children and the memoir she published last year, saying, "It's so great to be back." The memoir is an open book about some of the difficulties she has faced in her life. This results in a fantastic Broadway performance where Shannon asks various cast members to discuss their problems. Kearney claims they don't appear on the show very much; Bowen Yang is drawn to his therapist, Kenan Thompson is dependent on Rolex purchases and Andrew Dismukes still wears childish clothing, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><h2 class=split>'Best thing I have ever seen'</h2><p>One fan gushed, "This is the best thing I have ever seen. I love you so dearly, Molly Shannon &lt;3." "Yeeees!!!!! Comedic genius #SallyOMally is back!!," said another.
