I.O.I (Five Months)</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>South Korean girl group I.O.I was created due to CJ E&M’s participation in the “Produce 101” reality competition on Mnet. With the publication of their debut album, “Chrysalis,” on May 4, 2016, they made their debut and continued performing till 2017.</p><p style=text-align:justify>At the end of January 2017, the girl group formally split up.

On April 27, 2016, barely six months after their debut, TWICE’s lead single from the album, “Cheer Up,” became their first domestic chart-topper and brought them their first Perfect All-kill.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>5.
