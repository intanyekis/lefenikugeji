This caused a lot of curiosity among their fans, and it led to many asking, “Why did the Chrisleys go to prison?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-Did-The-Chrisleys-Go-To-Prison-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_the_Chrisleys></span><strong>Who Are the Chrisleys?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before we dive into the legal issues, let’s get to know the Chrisley family. Todd Chrisley is a real estate developer and businessman, while Julie Chrisley is a former beauty queen and author. Together, they have five children: Lindsie, Kyle, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson. The Chrisleys became famous in 2014 when their reality show, “Chrisley Knows Best,” premiered on the USA Network. The show showcased their extravagant lifestyle and sometimes chaotic family dynamics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legal_Troubles_Begin></span><strong>The Legal Troubles Begin</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chrisleys’ legal problems started in 2019 when they were indicted on charges of bank fraud and tax evasion. But what do these charges mean in simple terms?</p><ul><li><strong>Bank Fraud:</strong> Bank fraud is when someone tricks a bank into giving them money by providing false information. In the Chrisleys’ case, it was alleged that they used fake documents to obtain loans from banks. These loans added up to millions of dollars.</li><li><strong>Tax Evasion:</strong> Tax evasion means not paying the taxes you owe to the government. The Chrisleys were accused of hiding more than $30 million in income and not giving the IRS its share.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legal_Battle></span><strong>The Legal Battle</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chrisleys didn’t accept the charges against them. They pleaded “not guilty” to all the charges. However, their trial was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial finally began in May 2022 and lasted several weeks.</p><p>During the trial, the prosecutors presented evidence that the Chrisleys used fake documents to get money from banks, and they also showed that the Chrisleys didn’t report all of their income to the IRS.</p><p>On the other side, the defense argued that the Chrisleys didn’t do anything wrong. They said there wasn’t enough solid proof, but the jury thought otherwise. In June 2022, Todd Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and Julie Chrisley received a 7-year sentence. They were also told to pay back millions of dollars in restitution, which is like returning money they were accused of taking.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Appeals></span><strong>The Appeals</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though Todd and Julie Chrisley were found guilty and sentenced to prison, they haven’t given up. They’ve appealed their convictions, which means they’re asking a higher court to review the case and possibly change the outcome. But as of now, they remain in prison, and the appeal process is still ongoing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=So_Why_Did_They_Go_to_Prison></span><strong>So Why Did They Go to Prison?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In simple terms, the Chrisleys went to prison because they were convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion. They were accused of tricking banks into giving them lots of money using fake documents and not paying all the taxes they owed on their income. Even though they said they didn’t do anything wrong, a jury of regular people decided they did.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Future_for_the_Chrisleys></span><strong>The Future for the Chrisleys</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s unclear when or if the Chrisleys will get out of prison. They started serving their sentences in January 2023. Despite these legal troubles, the Chrisleys still have a lot of fans who follow them on social media, and their reality show continues to be watched by many.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the end, the Chrisleys’ case is a reminder that no matter how famous or successful someone is, they are not above the law. Bank fraud and tax evasion are serious crimes, and the legal system treats everyone equally when it comes to breaking the law. The Chrisleys’ story is a cautionary tale about the consequences that can come from financial dishonesty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQ></span><strong>FAQ</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Todd_and_Julie_Chrisley_charges></span><strong>Todd and Julie Chrisley charges?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Todd and Julie Chrisley were charged with bank fraud and tax evasion.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Todd_Chrisley_have_siblings></span><strong>Does Todd Chrisley have siblings?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Todd Chrisley has two siblings, Randy and Derrick Chrisley.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_kids_does_Todd_Chrisley_have></span><strong>How many kids does Todd Chrisley have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Todd Chrisley has five children: Lindsie, Kyle, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Todd_Chrisleys_mom_pass_away></span><strong>Did Todd Chrisley’s mom pass away?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yes, Todd Chrisley’s mother, Faye Chrisley, passed away on September 2, 2021.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Is Michael Strahan Dating, Married, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Instagram</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Beisner Bikini, Photos, Cheerleader, Age, Instagram, Wiki, Book</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Noa Tishby Legs, Bikini, Pics, Hot, Book, Age, The Affair, Instagram, Partner, Net Worth, Age</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtor5iueqW1w2aroZ1dmLWztdKlnLKrXZy8bsDOZqeroaOku3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./renee-leone-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bad News!
