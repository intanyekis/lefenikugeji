Despite the success, the period between 2016 and 2019 saw her feature in a plethora of films that did not necessarily perform well.</p><p>Then, of course, Jennifer dropped out of Hollywood, resurfacing some time later with a new baby and a fresh perspective on her career.</p><h2 id=how-long-was-jennifer-lawrence-away-from-hollywood>How Long Was Jennifer Lawrence Away From Hollywood?</h2><p>After shooting the Dark Phoenix, Jennifer Lawrence took a two-year hiatus from acting. Her next movie came out in December 2021 in the form of Don't Look Up. The actress had been engaged to Cooke Maroney since early 2019 and the couple tied the knot in October of the same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence Has Secret 'TikTok' Dedicated To 'Farm Life' And Baby Goats</a></span></p><p>They celebrated the birth of their first child recently, although Lawrence later claimed that her marriage, at least, had nothing to do with her break.

Her uncomfortable admission seemed pretty accurate; her pregnancy was during that Hollywood hiatus.</p><p>In a hilariously Jennifer fashion, Lawrence made it clear that she was focused on her marriage and starting a family while she was away from the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Jennifer Lawrence Threatened With Being Fired Unless She Lost Weight?</a></span></p><p>But after all of that busy time in the bedroom, and with a baby in her arms, did Jennifer second-guess her acting career, or is she coming back stronger than ever?</p><h2 id=did-jennifer-lawrence-quit-acting-because-she-had-a-baby>Did Jennifer Lawrence Quit Acting Because She Had A Baby?</h2><p>In a nutshell, there is little to suggest that <a href=#>the birth of Jennifer's baby</a> had much to do with her decision to quit acting for a spell.</p><p>By early 2018, Jennifer Lawrence was one of the highest-paid actors in the world. She had a plethora of movie offers in the follow-up to her Academy Awards success but does not seem too pleased with the choices that she made. But speaking to Vanity Fair, Lawrence suggested that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was not creating the kind of quality content</a> that she wanted to, and <a href=#>that was one reason for her departure from Hollywood</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was not pumping out the quality that I should have. I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I’d gotten sick of me. It had just gotten to a point where I couldn’t do anything right. If I walked a red carpet, it was, ‘Why didn’t she run?’… I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life. Working made me feel like nobody could be mad at me: ‘Okay, I said yes, we’re doing it. Nobody’s mad.’ And then I felt like I reached a point where people were not pleased just by my existence. So that kind of shook me out of thinking that work or your career can bring any kind of peace to your soul.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think Jennifer Lawrence Is A Victim Of This Weird Trend</a></span></p><p>The actress claimed that her hiatus had left her in good stead and that she planned to create movies that spoke to her, in the future:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The attention on me was so high and extreme that, in a bizarre way, the set had become a great escape. Everybody treats you normally. It’s not like you walk into hair and makeup and people are like, ‘Oh, my God!’ But you get burnt out. Eventually I had to ask myself, Am I saying yes because I want to go to work the next day? Or am I doing this because I want to make this movie?”</p><p>It does seem that Jennifer has turned things around now, and she's choosing projects she truly wants to do — at least, until she perhaps gets busy outside of work again and takes a similar break to expand her family further?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Did This Tabloid Say Jennifer Lawrence And Leonardo DiCaprio Were Dating?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecmepaehlpq%2FbrjAsKmeppOaeq2xwK%2BcZqCfobm6w86om2atnpi8rrLOq6uampyaeqbEz6WYp5mknryvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-child-stars-who-became-successful-adults-in-hollywood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Child Stars Who Became Successful Adults In Hollywood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-covers-time-magazines-firsts-issue-w501825.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez Covers 'Time' Magazines Firsts Issue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
