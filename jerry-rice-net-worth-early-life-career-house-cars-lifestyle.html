NFL Star</span></h2><p><strong>Jerry Lee Rice Sr.</strong>&nbsp;was born on October 13, 1962, in Starkville, Mississippi, in the United States of America.</p><p>He was born to his parents,&nbsp;<strong>Joe Nathan Rice</strong>&nbsp;and Eddie Rice. A few years later, his family relocated to a nearby town called Crawford. Rice’s father was a brick mason.</p><p>Whereas his mother’s occupation remains in the dark. The Mississippi-born enrolled in B.L. Moor High School in Oktoc, Mississippi, U.S.</p><p>At an early age, Jerry was passionate about football. However, his mother was skeptical and prohibited Rice from playing football.</p><p>It was up to fate to step in. One day the school’s principal noticed Jerry’s frequent absence.</p><p>When the principal confronted Rice, he sprinted away with such a pace that the headmaster consulted the football coach to place him on the team.</p><p>The Mississippian engaged in other sports like basketball and track and field to build stamina. After moving to Mississippi Valley State Valley University, Rice was a first-choice receiver and could catch anything thrown at him.</p><p>Together with fellow teammate&nbsp;<strong>Willie Toten,</strong>&nbsp;both became prominent as “The Satellite Express.” Their record was awe-inspiring, and they made a mark in the NCAA.</p><p>In Division I-AA, he set a record in 1983 and the next year broke it himself.</p><p>The two players were so phenomenal that the school named the stadium “Rice-Toten Stadium” to honor their best players.</p><p>Rice’s record-breaking, sensational performance got noticed by many NFL scouts. Ultimately 49ers signed him.</p><h3><span id=Excellence_Is_More_Than_A_Practice>Excellence Is More Than A Practice</span></h3><p>Jerry Rice is best known for his unwavering consistency, hard work, and dedication. Even when it comes to his workout routine, he was famous for his hustle on the team.</p><p>Often, Jerry would be the last one to leave the training.</p><p>He conducted his own six-day-a-week off-season workouts.</p><p>During his workout days, he would devote his mornings to cardiovascular work, five-mile trail, and wind sprints.</p><p>Following it, he would do his weight training in the afternoon.</p><h2><span id=Jerry_Rice_Net_Worth_Career_Earnings_Endorsements_Businesses>Jerry Rice Net Worth | Career Earnings, Endorsements, & Businesses</span></h2><p>With a career ranging from the Francisco 49ers, and Oakland Raiders to Seattle Seahawks, the American earned a close&nbsp;<strong>$42.4 million</strong>&nbsp;in his 20 years long career. Rice’s net worth would increase significantly if he signed with the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Nonetheless, his decision to retire didn’t stop him from earning a little extra cash. On the other hand, the wide receiver pocketed a signing record of a&nbsp;<strong>$4 million</strong>&nbsp;bonus.</p><p>Likewise, Jerry made a&nbsp;<strong>$1.6 million salary</strong>, cashing in a&nbsp;<strong>$5.6 million</strong>&nbsp;total pay in 1996.</p><p>The NFL star started with a base salary of&nbsp;<strong>$700 k</strong>&nbsp;and ended his career with&nbsp;<strong>$876,470</strong>. In addition, the American averaged a median wage of<strong>&nbsp;$2 million</strong>&nbsp;throughout his playing tenure.</p><p>Jerry’s career highlight was sure to follow him in retirement. Subsequently, the former receiver was featured in several media.</p><p>In the same way, Rice was part of Visa, All Sport, and Gatorade.</p><p>In like manner, the former NFL player appeared in Dancing with the Stars, pairing with&nbsp;<strong>Anna Trebunskaya,</strong>&nbsp;and even reached the finals.</p><p>Rice delved into acting with the movie Without a Paddle: Nature’s Calling and the sitcom Rules of Engagement.</p><p>Apart from these, the retired player co-authored the book&nbsp;Rice&nbsp;and&nbsp;Go Long: My Journey Beyond the Game and the Fame. As of recent, Rice co-hosted Sports Sunday, broadcasted in San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Notwithstanding, Jerry actively supports the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress. Above all, the&nbsp;61-year-old established and endorsed several organizations like Jerry Rice 127 Foundation, National Kidney Foundation, and Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><h2><span id=Jerry_Rice_Career_Stats>Jerry Rice | Career Stats</span></h2><table width=500><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td><strong>G</strong></td><td><strong>Rec</strong></td><td><strong>Yds</strong></td><td><strong>Avg</strong></td><td><strong>TD</strong></td><td><strong>Att</strong></td><td><strong>Yds</strong></td><td><strong>Avg</strong></td><td><strong>TD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>49</td><td>927</td><td>18.9</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>26</td><td>4.3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1986</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>86</td><td>1,570</td><td>18.3</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>72</td><td>7.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>12</td><td>65</td><td>1,078</td><td>16.6</td><td>22</td><td>8</td><td>51</td><td>6.4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>64</td><td>1,306</td><td>20.4</td><td>9</td><td>13</td><td>107</td><td>8.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>1,483</td><td>18.1</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>33</td><td>6.6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>100</td><td>1,502</td><td>15.0</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>80</td><td>1,206</td><td>15.1</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>84</td><td>1,201</td><td>14.3</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>58</td><td>6.4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>98</td><td>1,503</td><td>15.3</td><td>15</td><td>3</td><td>69</td><td>23.0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>112</td><td>1,499</td><td>13.4</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>93</td><td>13.3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>122</td><td>1,848</td><td>15.1</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>36</td><td>7.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>108</td><td>1,254</td><td>11.6</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>77</td><td>7.0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>78</td><td>11.1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-10</td><td>-10.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>1,157</td><td>14.1</td><td>9</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>67</td><td>830</td><td>12.4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>13</td><td>6.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>75</td><td>805</td><td>10.7</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>-2</td><td>-2.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>83</td><td>1,139</td><td>13.7</td><td>9</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>92</td><td>1,211</td><td>13.2</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>20</td><td>6.7.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>63</td><td>869</td><td>13.8</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>Oakland/Seattle</td><td>17</td><td>30</td><td>429</td><td>14.3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>Career Total</td><td>303</td><td>1,549</td><td>22,895</td><td>14.8</td><td>197</td><td>87</td><td>645</td><td>7.4</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Jerry_Rice_Net_Worth_Houses_Cars_Lifestyle>Jerry Rice Net Worth | Houses, Cars, & Lifestyle</span></h2><p>To begin with, the retired NFL star owned a luxurious&nbsp;<strong>$9 million</strong>&nbsp;mansion. It isn’t just any fancy-looking house; it’s a smart house. You heard it correctly. Not a single penny got used on useless purchases.</p><p>To illustrate, the house had six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a movie theatre, a pool house, and a gift-wrapping room.</p><p>It sounds strange, but it is cool at the same. Jerry Rice’s net worth would be meaningless without a bit of spending, right?</p><p>In addition, the custom-made house gives the owner full autonomy over the house. Whether the owner is a few miles away or across seven seas, the satellite system built in the house is accessible from anywhere on Earth.</p><p>Moving on, the pool house sits in a large area, which gives the vibe of some luxurious hotel pool but just with some special modesty to it.</p><p>Likewise, the large acre of land houses a deck where family or guests can sit back and enjoy themselves in front of a green yard.</p><p>A separate dining table is present in cases of the arrival of many guests. Further, the gift-wrapping room is technically a state-of-art commodity stocked with various wrapping papers.</p><h3><span id=Other_Area_Of_Smart_House>Other Area Of Smart House</span></h3><p>Most importantly, the kitchen is what attracts more attention. Some striking designs include a few overhanging lamps, a large counter, a beautifully ornated wall, a double wall oven, and a neatly lined cabinet to place cutleries.</p><p>We can talk about the great space all day, but we would like to add more. There is a private home office, a theatre room that seats almost 9-12 people, a cozy breakfast nook, and a gym room.</p><p>In 2007, Jerry listed it for&nbsp;<strong>$22 million</strong>&nbsp;but, as of late, sold it for&nbsp;<strong>$9 million</strong>. Buyers will be lucky to have this accommodation for such a reasonable price. Above all, the compound comes with a large backyard.</p><p>At present, Rice owns a mansion in Atherton, California. In particular, the exquisite residence took exactly a year to design and three years to build. The house has designer furniture, a gym room, a theatre, and a pool.</p><p>Jerry lives with her wife, Latisha Pelayo, whom he has dated since 2008. The couple got &nbsp;married on October 21, 2019,</p><h3><span id=Car>Car</span></h3><p>Now, let’s move to his car collections. The NFL receiver owns a yellow Lamborghini Diablo, which cost him about&nbsp;<strong>$690 k</strong>. There must be several collections that do not make public mention.</p><p>Jerry fondly travels with his wife to exotic and adventurous locations during his leisure time.</p><p>The retired NFL icon, a major golf fan, passes the time on the golf course.</p><h2><span id=Jerry_Rice_2022_Update>Jerry Rice | 2022 Update</span></h2><p>Jerry Rice has overcome his fear of needles by working with the American Red Cross to promote blood donation and assist in saving lives in April 2022.</p><p>With his new partnership, the NFL legend hopes to make a difference.</p><p>In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, he stated that he wants to raise awareness of the American Red Cross’s need for blood donations for transfusions, sickle cell disease, victims of car accidents, and women experiencing difficulties during childbirth.</p><h3 class=article-headline><span id=Brand_Ambassador_To_EasyKnock>Brand Ambassador To EasyKnock</span></h3><p>Jerry rice in 2022 will serve as Brand Ambassador to EasyKnock, as announced.</p><p>EasyKnock description,</p><p>“EasyKnock’s innovative service provides an alternative to traditional financing options by enabling homeowners to convert the equity they have worked hard to build by selling their home, getting the cash they need, and remaining in their home as a renter”.</p><p>This collaboration will undoubtedly help Jerry earn even more.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Hotel Transylvania Movies in Order?
