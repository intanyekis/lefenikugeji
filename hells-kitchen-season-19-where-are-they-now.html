Season 19 of the show takes the drama, stakes, and excitement to the next level, showcasing a group of diverse contestants trying to prove their mettle in the intense environment of a professional kitchen. As the heat turns up, contestants face numerous challenges and compete for the prize of $250,000 and a job as a head chef or executive chef at a restaurant chosen by Gordon himself. It’s been a while since the season ended in 2021, leaving fans curious about the whereabouts of these chefs.</p><h2>Kenneth McDuffie is Working on His Cookbook Today</h2><p>A private chef from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kenneth made a rookie mistake in the second episode of the season and got eliminated. After leaving Hell’s Kitchen, he went back to his catering business, Young & Hungry Catering, and has been working there ever since. In 2022, he won the Metro Philly’s Best Food Category for his “7 Cheese Baked Macaroni”. He has also made an appearance in several other TV shows and channels and has been featured in the TUV Magazine.</p><p>Kenneth claims that being on ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ helped him turn his life around, and now, he has lost a ton of weight, bought a new flat, and has a successful catering company.

After ‘Hell’s Kitchen,’ he continues to work as a private chef and has his own website where he offers catering services, cookery classes, and dinner parties. It is possible that he might have started a fish lure business with his father, with whom he also shares a passion for fishing.</p><h2>Fabiola Fuentes is a Photographer Now</h2><p>Fabiola Fuentes was working as a line cook in Indio, California, when she got the opportunity to become a contestant in Gordon Ramsay’s ‘Hell’s Kitchen’. However, things took a turn for the worse when, due to an unexpected medical emergency and her poor performance, she was eliminated in the third episode. Even though the medics diagnosed the issue as dehydration, it hasn’t stopped the fans from speculating that Fabiola might have been having a panic attack or could have possibly been drunk. After leaving the show, she continues to follow her passion for cooking and has even taken up a new career avenue and become a photographer.</p><h2>Drew Tingley is Going to Release His Cookbook Soon</h2><p>Prior to ‘Hell’s Kitchen,’ Drew Tingley was a line cook in Indio, California.
