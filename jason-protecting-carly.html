Was hoping they were going to tie it to Morgan. I’m curious what exactly they have on her.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t think is surprising to anybody. But what I do find surprising is how they’ve created 2 camps of Jason supporters vs not supporters. I think it has created some great relationship drama and for the first time in a long time we see some folks not blindly hero worshipping him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I really thought it was his kids he was talking about at the beginning regarding him being threatened. I would think that would be the worst thing that could happen is for something to happen to his children. I see no reason why anybody would be after Carly anyway.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I would like to know exactly what charges under “Rico” Carly is guilty of. Is it related to the stock she bought and lost money?</p><p>This is what I found in regards to RICO. “To violate RICO, a person must engage in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. The law defines 35 offenses as constituting racketeering, including <strong>gambling, murder, kidnapping, arson, drug dealing, bribery</strong>. Significantly, mail and wire fraud are included on the list.”</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I’m sure he would do the same to protect his kids, but this probably extends the drama because if it was the kids and the truth came out, everyone would understand. However with it being Carly, we will see her struggle with his sacrifice and others will feel he chose Carly over his kids. It’s funny that for decades the Feds could not get evidence to jail Sonny but Carly runs the mob for a hot minute and they have irrefutable evidence. I thought Diane could get anyone cleared of mob charges.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>It’s not big surprise Jason loves Carly, he always has. He would die for her.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>The timing of the stock purchase would not work because the Feds had the leverage over Jason back when he climbed out of the rubble over 2 years ago. I assume it was something that happened while Carly was briefly running the mob when Sonny was in Nixon Falls.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/3da27b/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> ghyrfanforlife:<p>Carly runs the mob for a hot minute and they have irrefutable evidence.</p><p>So, if this is the reason Carly is being targeted looks like Nina keeping Sonny in NF created this situation. Carly stepped in to keep Sonny’s “business” going. Jason should stick that in Sonny’s face.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Haden</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 3, 2024, 1:22pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>I think Carly being the target of the RICO violations is two-fold. One, yes she and Jason ran the business while Sonny was in NF. That right there places her on the radar of the FBI. Two, the FBI has always wanted to us Carly to get to Sonny. I think Jason knows this and while his primary target is protecting Carly, he knows in a roundabout way he is protecting Sonny and the entire family too.</p><p>I always knew it was going to be Carly. Jason has never been afraid of charges that are brought against him. He would not have done all of this with the FBI to help himself. He knew Sonny would always have Diane to get him off, so yes it had to be Carly that the FBI was using to leverage Jason.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>Please take her with him when he goes.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>Diane is also Carly’s lawyer. I guess we are meant to assume that the evidence is so damning that not even Diane could save Carly in the court.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Haden</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 3, 2024, 1:41pm <span itemprop=position>15</span></span><p>I guess…but seriously what has Carly done that is sooooo much worse than Sonny? I still think Jason knows he has to protect Carly, and that also protects Sonny and the fam.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Isnt this issue that Carly and Drew did over with?

Cause I don’t like it. It is not what we thought, hoped it would be. At all.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>She did commit securities fraud when she engaged in insider trading which is rico crime.<br>I think also has to do with the fact she didn’t turn on Sonny during the sec issue. She had also stood in for Sonny when Jason was on the run and Sonny was thought dead as the head of his organization. The amount of time doesn’t matter. The act does. She may be considered part of the organization by association with Sonny. She doesn’t have to engage in any illegal activities.<br>lol Being his wife for so many years certainly covers the association part plus she knew a lot of what was going on in his world.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>The SEC charges likely have nothing to do with whatever they have on her. Jason “died” long before that happened. He said he was taken by the FBI right after the collapse so the timing doesn’t work for those charges. My guess it has something to do with when Sonny was “dead” and Carly and Jason were runnin the business.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I know and that is what I thought too that it was something before or at the time of Sonny’s death. Since she has not been arrested can’t the list of violations continue to grow?</p><p>Oh yes, of course.<br>It does seem interesting that none of this was ever mentioned by the feds when the SEC charges were in play. I am guessing the reason for that is because at the time we had a different set of writers and Jason was still dead. This storyline seems to have been thought up after that other stuff.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvJmqqopl2lv7DAxJyroqaXYrCivsuyZnFqZWqCeA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-bradley-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-622677-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Bradley Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-wrestling-moves-that-need-to-be-banned-from-wwe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Wrestling Moves That Need To Be Banned From WWE</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
