She couldn’t enter the Miss Sweden pageant that year because she was in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageant. Previous reports said that Anka took part in Miss Sweden in 1994, but Veckorevyn, which owned and ran the Miss Sweden beauty pageant at the time, couldn’t find any proof that she did.

After that, they looked at the surveillance footage from their mansion and found no evidence of such an event. Even so, a day after he filed suit, Anna got a restraining order against him. [16] Paul said in his lawsuit, among other things, that Anna hurt him during an argument in November 2009 and the police charged her with felony domestic battery, but Paul told the police to drop the charges at the time.
