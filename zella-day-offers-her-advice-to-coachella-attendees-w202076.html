Sick! I’m playing Coachella! Yeah!’ It was a really good moment — barbecue and tears.”</p><p>Not only will this be the “Hypnotic” singer’s first time performing at the music festival, but it will also be the first time she attends the full event.</p><p>“I’ve been to Coachella for like, three hours, literally,” the singer-songwriter says. “I went two years ago when Outkast was playing and I had a friend who had a last-minute ticket that they weren’t using, so I just went to watch Outkast, but I left right after cause I had nowhere to stay.”</p><p>While Zella is a Coachella rookie, she has experience with the festival circuit, having performed at BottleRock, AxS and Hangout Music Festival in 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They’re exhausting and you really need to pace yourself, especially if you’re going to be staying and enjoying the festival outside of your own performance,” she advises. “It’s really taxing and there’s a lot of people to talk to and the element at Coachella is very intense. I’m making sure that I’m drinking more water than I am wine, and getting more sleep than I am pulling all-nighters so that I can really sustain myself.”</p><p>As far as her festival style goes, she says, "I want it to be a surprise, but it’s one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. It’s vintage, it’s all silk, it has three pieces and it’s all the same fabric. It looks kind of…I can’t, I can’t, I can’t give it away! I’m sorry! I’m so excited!”</p><p>The singer-songwriter will be performing on both April 16 and April 23, where she will perform songs from her 2015 album, <i>Kicker</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaznZyhrm6wwLJkqJ6Wmr%2B0eceeqWaZlKu2pLGMraZmm5%2BWsKmxy6WYZpmkqbKvsMSeqmavYmV%2FcYOVaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Actors Who Rose To Fame Before Turning 18 (Not On The Disney Channel)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./camila-mendes-ex-boyfriend-victor-houston-doing-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Lavish Lifestyle Of Camila Mendes Ex-Boyfriend Victor Houston</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
