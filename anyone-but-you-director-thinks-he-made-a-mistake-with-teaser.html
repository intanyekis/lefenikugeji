Gluck, 45, admitted in an interview published on Thursday, November 16, that he got “too cute” with the clip.</p><p>“I blame myself,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “The teaser wasn’t well received and I put that completely on my own shoulders. We tried to get too cute with it.”</p><p>Gluck explained, “It is a big fun comedy, and if you saw that teaser without anything else, you’d think, ‘Is someone going to get killed? Is this a thriller?’ That was a mistake on my part. I just wanted people to lean in and say, ‘What is this?’”</p><p>The teaser features Sweeney’s character, Bea, and Powell’s Ben agreeing to pretend they’re a couple while at a destination wedding. (Bea’s parents are trying to set her up with her ex-boyfriend, while Ben is trying to make his ex jealous.)</p><p>In the clip, they danced together and got cozy on a boat while “I Hate the Way That I Love You” by <strong>Labrinth</strong> played in the background, but the teaser wasn’t exactly giving romantic comedy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Anyone-But-You-Director-Will-Gluck-Admits-He-Got-Too-Cute-With-the-Teaser-I-Blame-Myself-251.jpg><p>“Why does this watch like a teaser trailer for a psychological thriller without telling people that it’s a psychological thriller,” one fan wondered in the comments of the YouTube upload. A second added, “This music doesn’t feel like it fits the trailer but I’m still excited to watch it!!! Looks cute!” Another viewer wrote, “This teaser left me with no idea what this movie is actually about.”</p><p>The <a href=#>full-length trailer</a> dropped on Thursday, giving fans a little more insight into the plot. The pair previously hooked up but quickly realized their personalities weren’t a good fit. While spending time together at a wedding, Bea and Ben fool their friends and family into thinking they’re dating by showing affection to each other, enjoying meals together and dancing.</p><p>Anyone But You has sparked plenty of conversation, with fans wondering earlier this year whether Powell, 35, and Sweeney, 26, were more than just costars after seeing behind-the-scenes footage of the two cuddling up. Sweeney is engaged to <strong>Jonathan Davino</strong>, while <a href=#>Powell split from</a> girlfriend <strong>Gigi Paris</strong> in April as the movie wrapped filming.</p><p>Powell recently <a href=#>addressed the alleged affair</a>&nbsp;in his <a href=#>Men’s Health</a> cover story. “When all that stuff happened, you know, publicly, it felt disorienting and unfair,” he said. “But what I’m realizing is that’s just a part of this gig now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued, “If you talk to a girl or something like that, and you’re like, ‘We have a really great connection, we’re having a really great interaction,’ and then they ask you for a selfie, it’s like, ‘Oh ….”</p><p>Sweeney also got candid <a href=#>about the rumors</a> in an August interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. “Sometimes I feel beat up by it,” she admitted. “It’s hard to sit back and watch, and not be able to stand up for yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinsZ%2Bjsm6u1K1ksqelYrGqvsScq6iqXam1qrrKrGShnV2irqWxjJpkpqGjqa6ssYywoK2gXamyor%2FEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-hung-out-with-ex-fiance-jason-trawick-on-vegas-trip.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Hung Out with Ex-Fianc Jason Trawick on Vegas Trip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./witney-carson-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Witney Carson Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
