Usher was just singing it. But people kind of bought into it, it was just the timing of our breakup when the album came out.”</p><p>“So people assumed that album was about us, but it was not,” she continued. “And Usher and I weren’t oil and water. We broke up because I guess it was that time or whatever,” she added wistfully: “he was that real love for me.”</p><p>Thomas, who, together with <strong>Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins</strong> and the late <strong>Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes</strong>, formed 90s mega girl group TLC, even admitted that she will “always love” Usher, despite the fact that the pair called it quits on their relationship in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“In any relationship, even when it came to my relationship with Usher, when it was time to make a move, I had to do that,” she said. “I don’t care how much my heart was hurting, sometimes you’re just supposed to be with people for a reason and it’s not always a lifetime. Even if you want it to be, it just doesn’t work out that way.”&nbsp;</p><p>“But I’ll always love him, forever, because he was my first adult love, a real love,” she added. “But we’re cool, we’re really cool. There’s no hard feelings, nothing like that. It’s all good.”&nbsp;</p><p>After the pair split, Usher went on to date and eventually marry stylist <strong>Tameka Foster</strong> in August 2007. The “OMG” crooner filed for divorce in 2009; the couple have two sons together — <strong>Usher V</strong>, 5, and <strong>Naviyd</strong>, 4.</p><p>In recent years, the former couple has duked it out in an ugly court custody battle, but it’s not something that Thomas can sympathize with.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I didn’t have anything to do with it and I was very far away from it,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “I wasn’t a part of any of that kind of stuff. Our relationship was never like that. That’s his story.”</p><p>Both Thomas and Watkins are producers on VH1’s upcoming biopic, Crazy, Sexy Cool: The TLC Story, which will air on Sunday, Oct. 20, and stars rapper <strong>Lil Mama</strong>, Akeela & the Bee star <strong>KeKe Palmer</strong>, and The Game actress <strong>Drew Sidora</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatpJOoeqS0yKWjomWlqLWmvoywmKxlna56p7XRrKtmqpWWuW64zq%2BcZqCVYrumwsSrZJyglZbBprCMqKVmpZVif3F9kmtoamhf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-dave-smith-2017-chat-between-user-and-musk-on-buying-domain-6-goes-viral.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Dave Smith? 2017 Chat Between User And Musk On Buying Twitter Goes Viral The Talks Today</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1380742-stardom-results-6-18-23-remaining-5star-competitors-determined.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>STARDOM Results (6/18/23): Remaining 5STAR Competitors Determined</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
