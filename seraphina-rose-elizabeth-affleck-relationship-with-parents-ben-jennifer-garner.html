Before Ben got sober, a lot of the parental responsibility fell on Jennifer’s shoulders. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the aftermath of her divorce, Jennifer said</a> “I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”</p><p>It may have taken some time to get adjusted, but Jennifer seems to have the whole mom thing on lock these days. She can be spotted on her TikTok and Instagram whipping up fun, healthy lunches for her kids.</p><p>Jennifer and Ben also have an amazing co-parenting relationship now. “They stay on top of things and have a lot of meetings and check-ins. They want to be the best parents they can for the kids. If they have differences, they keep it to themselves and don’t let it have an impact. They always put on happy faces for the kids and put their well-being first,” a source close to the family told Us Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-get-along-with-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Does Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Get Along With Jennifer Lopez?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emme-maribel-mun-iz-and-seraphina-affleck-going-to-a-movie-together-2021-la.jpg><p>We don’t know Seraphina Rose Elizabeth’s true feelings about Jennifer Lopez because they have never expressed them publicly.

They also both identify as non-binary and prefer the use of they/them pronouns. While it’s never been confirmed by Emme, Seraphina, or their parents, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans believe that Emme was pivotal in helping Seraphina come to terms with her gender</a> and begin using non-binary pronouns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Lopez has been incredibly supportive of Emme as she navigates her teenage years.

They are very, very busy. Booked. And pricey. They cost me when they come out. But they’re worth every single penny because they’re my favorite duet partner of all time. So if you will indulge me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Stars Who Have Come Out As Non-Binary</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben and Jennifer were keen on ensuring their families seamlessly blended together after their nuptials, and seeing how close Emme and Seraphina have become must warm their hearts. “Since Jennifer and Ben are in it for the long run, it‘s just a natural step that they all spend time together with the kids,” a source close to the couple said to People Magazine.</p><p>The couple has been lining up plans for them and their children to help keep them all connected and form true bonds. “They are not trying to rush anything, but they want all the kids to get to know each other,” said the source.</p><h2 id=does-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-want-to-be-an-actor-like-their-parents><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Does Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Want To Be An Actor Like Their Parents?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ben-affleck-on-a-walk-with-seraphina-affleck-in-2020.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck has actively discouraged his children from becoming actors.

But I also wouldn’t want to take my kids and push them out there before they were 18. If they are 18 and they want to make those choices and do that kind of thing, that’s fine. But being a child actor, I just know too much of the downside of what that can be like.”</p><h2 id=will-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-be-going-to-college><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Will Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Be Going To College?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ben-affleck-spotted-with-emme-muniz-and-seraphina-affleck-in-2021.jpg><p>Seraphina Rose Elizabeth is only 14-years-old, so they won’t be going to college anytime soon, but Jennifer and Ben have both hinted that they want their kids to receive top-tier education.
