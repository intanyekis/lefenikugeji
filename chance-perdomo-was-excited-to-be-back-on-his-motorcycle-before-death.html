His passion for the arts and insatiable appetite for life was felt by all who knew him, and his warmth will carry on in those who he loved dearest. We ask to please respect the family’s wish for privacy as they mourn the loss of their beloved son and brother.”</p><p>Producers for Prime Video’s Gen V, season 2 of <a href=#>which was Perdomo’s next project</a>, released a statement as well.</p><p>“We can’t quite wrap our heads around this. For those of us who knew him and worked with him, Chance was always charming and smiling, an enthusiastic force of nature, an incredibly talented performer, and more than anything else, just a very kind, lovely person,” their joint statement read. “Even writing about him in the past tense doesn’t make sense. We are so sorry for Chance’s family, and we are grieving the loss of our friend and colleague. Hug your loved ones tonight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chance-Perdomo-Was-Excited-to-Be-Back-on-the-Road-Before-His-Death-Final-Calm-Before-Storm-805.jpg><p>Perdomo rose to stardom after playing Ambrose in the Netflix series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.
