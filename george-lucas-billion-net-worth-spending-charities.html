In 2012, George Lucas decided it was time to retire and he hung up his lightsaber. <strong>Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Walt Disney Studios</strong> and became an extraordinarily wealthy person.</p><p>Of course, the burning question on everyone’s mind is, "How does George Lucus spend his billions"?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>George Lucas spends a little bit of his fortune on himself.
