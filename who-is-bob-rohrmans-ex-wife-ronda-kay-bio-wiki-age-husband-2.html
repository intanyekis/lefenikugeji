Bob was an American businessman born in a log cabin on a rented farm in Lafayette, Indiana. He launched his first dealership, a Lafayette used-car lot, and opened his first new car dealership, a Toyota franchise, seven years later.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronda-kay-age></span><span>Ronda Kay Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronda is 47 years old as of 2020. However, the exact&nbsp;<strong>date of birth</strong> of Kay is not yet known to the public. As such, it is difficult to establish her actual age or when she celebrates her birthday. Nevertheless, we are keeping tabs and will update you once this information is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronda-kay-bob-rohrman-death></span><span>Ronda Kay Bob Rohrman Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronda’s ex-husband Bob died on Tuesday, 2nd Sept 2020, in his Schaumburg condo at the age of 87. His cause of death was identified to be natural causes</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronda-kay-ex-husband-bob-rohrman></span><span>Ronda Kay Ex-Husband Bob Rohrman</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ronda’s ex-husband was a well-known Auto dealer and TV pitchman. He launched his first dealership, a Lafayette used-car lot in 1963, and opened his first new car dealership, a Toyota franchise, seven years later.&nbsp;Over the years, his auto group expanded to Illinois and Wisconsin, and now comprises 27 dealerships, including 12 in the Chicago area.</p><p>But it was his ubiquitous TV&nbsp;commercials&nbsp;that made him a household name in Chicago. During Halloween, he was Count Bobula, a caped vampire gesturing in front of a cardboard cemetery set to “take a bite out of high prices,” while at Christmastime he was Santa Bob, hyping holiday sales. Other characters included Dr. Bob the Car-Deal-Ologist, a “Star Wars” Stormtrooper, and a king.</p><p>For some, the favored spots were his blooper reels, a succession of outtakes only slightly less polished than the finished product, where Rohrman would blow his lines, crack himself up and good-naturedly mug for the camera.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronda-kay-divorce></span><span>Ronda Kay Divorce</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>About two years ago, Ronda began a furtive relationship with a local plastic surgeon, whom Rohrman sued last June for alienation of affection, an antique legal means of financially punishing those who steal the hearts of the theretofore happily hitched. “I’m an open book,” he told his Illinois divorce attorney, Enrico Mirabelli, who shared the tale of the Rohrmans’ love woes with the&nbsp;Chicago Sun-Times,&nbsp;which sent the story up the newswire, where it inspired nationwide gawking from sources as disparate as Fox News and the constitutional law guru Jonathan Turley.</p><p>“I said to him, ‘So you made the news, huh?’” says Lew Neuman, the architect and friend who has designed many of Rohrman’s dealerships. “And he said, ‘Wooooooooo, yeah, babe, what do you think about that?’”</p><p>Rohrman insists he thinks nothing of any of it—and to observe him is to believe him. “I’ve seen him cold at football games, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him sweat,” Neuman claims. So while the times are troubled, Rohrman is not. Enrico Mirabelli says, “I told him, ‘You remind me of a blind guy walking through a minefield, just whistling and happy, oblivious to all the danger around you.’”</p><p>Pam Bockwinkel, the comptroller for Rohrman’s Illinois dealerships, adds, “August [2008] is when it really started hitting us across the board at all of the stores. When September wasn’t going much better, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ Because at that point, everybody was all doom and gloom. He looked at me and said, ‘Babe, this could be really good for us. Those dealers that make it to the other side are going to be stronger and better prepared for what comes next.’”</p><p>“I used to worry about everything,” Rohrman explains. “That’s when I was younger and just starting out. I always would worry about losing all of my money and getting poor again. After I decided it was too easy to make money, I didn’t worry anymore.” Here, knowing what only he knows, he snickers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronda-kay-net-worth></span><span>Ronda Kay Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kay has not revealed her net worth. She is a simple person and never likes to attract public attention by publicly displaying her wealth.
