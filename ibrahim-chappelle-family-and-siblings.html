Among such lists, <strong>Ibrahim Chappelle</strong> is a star kid who is the son of <strong>Dave Chappelle</strong>, a global renown stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer.</p><p>Dave is known for his successful comedy sketch series, <i>Chappelle's Show</i>. Dave and his wife, <strong>Elaine Chappelle, </strong>has two children apart from Ibrahim. The family resides on a 65-acre farm near Yellow Springs, Ohio. Let's explore more about Ibrahim's personal life.</p><h2>Ibrahim Chappelle's Dating Life</h2><p>Chappelle is single and very young to get involved in romantic relationships. His parents are very concerned about putting him in front of media attention. As of now, he is busy with his studies and focused on starting his career shortly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/17/DaveIbrahim-1573969425356.jpg><p>Despite being recognized as Dave's son, Ibrahim is pretty reserved in his personal life. He rarely steps out in front of the media without his parents.</p><h2>Ibrahim Chappelle Family</h2><p>His father, Dave, married his wife, <a href=#><strong>Elaine Chappelle</strong></a>, in 2001. Despite being a loved celebrity couple, the husband-wife duo has managed to keep details of their relationship to themselves. As of now, Elaine manages several properties her husband purchased in Ohio.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/17/Chappelle_family-1573969279336.jpg><p>The Chappelle family consists of five members altogether. Not just Ibrahim, his siblings are also very secretive when it comes to revealing their personal life.</p><p>His mother, Elaine, wanted to become a professional chef; however, she is now a house maker. Elaine was born in the Philippines. She once appeared in the backstage segment of <i>The Age of Spin: Dave Chappelle</i> Live at the Hollywood Palladium 2017.</p><p>Ibrahim's father, Dave, is the winner of two Emmy and two Grammy award winners. In 2016, he signed a <strong>$20 million</strong> pre-release comedy-special deal with Netflix. But his latest special received with a lot of criticism as it is <a href=#><strong>offending to critics</strong></a> as per <i>CNBC</i>.</p><h2>Ibrahim Chappelle's Siblings</h2><p>The star kid shares the media limelight with his two other siblings, a brother named <a href=#><strong>Sulayman Chappelle</strong></a>, and a sister named, <a href=#><strong>Sonal Chappelle</strong></a>. Dave's sons have Islamic names because he joined the Islam religion in 1988.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/17/Chappellefamily-1573969644999.jpg><p>The Chappelle siblings are rarely spotted on public places as their parents are extremely cautious about their privacy. Ibrahim, along with brother, Sulayman, and sister, Sanaa, might be studying in a reputed academy.</p><h2>Dave Chappelle About His Kids</h2><p>In the 2017 interview with <i>CBS</i>, Dave told that his professional comedy career changed after he had kids. He said:</p><p>“Everything changed after I had children. I took my professional life more seriously. And I think, as a dude, I had more depth after I had kids.”</p><p>After having kids, Dave once went on a spiritual retreat in Africa. He took a break for some handful of years but eventually returned to the spotlight.</p><h2>Ibrahim Chappelle's Parents' Net Worth</h2><p>Among the list of successful stand-up comedians, Dave Chappelle is one of them with an estimated net worth of over <strong>$50 million</strong> as of 2019.
