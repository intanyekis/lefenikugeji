It’s been alleged Margera ghosted production after <a href=#>checking himself into a Florida rehab</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio Helps Climate Fund Raise $45 Million</a></span></p><p>However, the professional skateboarder was <a href=#>quick to file a wrongful termination lawsuit</a> blaming production for the problems that occurred while filming.&nbsp;Margera named Jackass Forever director Jeff Tremaine, star Johnny Knoxville, and studio Paramount Pictures in the suit.</p><p>Last year, it was reported Margera was seeking millions of dollars in compensation. He also requested an injunction to stop the film from releasing in October 2021, though it was eventually delayed due to COVID scheduling conflicts.</p><p>“I did not have any issues with addiction and drug use until I began my involvement […] with the Jackass franchise,” Margera stated in court documents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued to explain that he became “dependent on Adderall and pain medications” to keep up with the filming schedule for the production and his other projects.</p><p>Margera later told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> his lawsuit wasn’t just about compensation but about principle. "My lawsuit isn't just about compensation,” he said. “It's about treating people with mental health and addiction issues in an honest manner and not taking advantage of their disabilities to rip them off."</p><p>Earlier this month, it was reported that Margera reached a private settlement regarding the lawsuit, though the terms and conditions haven’t been publicly revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it appears Margera is focusing on moving past the legal battle. Sharing with his 2.3 million Instagram followers, the actor shared a video of himself working out. “A healthy outside, starts from the inside,” he captioned the clip. “Road to recovery with unconditional friend @brandon_novak.”</p><p>Despite settling this lawsuit, the Jackass franchise is still in ongoing litigation over a prank that went wrong. In February, we reported that production was <a href=#>hit with a $12 million lawsuit</a> launched by Michael Vicens-Segura.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plaintiff claims he sustained life-threatening injuries after a stunt feature a jet ski didn’t go as planned. Vicens-Segura emphasized&nbsp;he’s been unable to work due to the severity of his injuries, which included brain bleeding and a fractured skull. The case remains ongoing.</p><p>After a delay, Jackass Forever debuted at the top of the box office last February. <a href=#>It earned $23 million</a> on its opening weekend, replacing Spider-Man Forever in first place.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Sued For Copyright Infringement Over 2019 Collaboration</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, <a href=#>Cinema Blend</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvormMppirn5Wnrm6%2FxK2rpZ2jYreir8qaqqxlnJbEtMHIrWSfp5OqwKq6xmapnpufq7KzxY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./damian-lillard-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Damian Lillard Net Worth [2023 Update]: Salary &amp;amp; Rap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./winklevoss-twins-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Winklevoss Twins Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
