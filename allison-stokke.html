She now competes as a pole vaulter and works as a model.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Allison_Stokke_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Allison Stokke? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Her current <strong>net worth</strong> is estimated to be more than $600,000, and it is gradually increasing as a result of her sports and modeling careers.</p><h2><span id=Allison_Stokke-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Allison Stokke- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Allison spent her entire upbringing in Newport Beach with her parents, Allan and Cindy Stokke — both her mother and father are avid sports fans, and Allison inherited their passion. She has an elder brother, David, who is also quite athletic and has become a gymnast competing in national competitions.</p><p>Allison attempted gymnastics for the first time when attending Newport Harbor High School; she was particularly interested in pole vaulting, and it didn’t take her long to become one of the top teenage vaulters in the United States. Her first major accomplishment came in 2004 when she won the US title with a leap of 3.81m (12ft 6ins).</p><p>Some of the marks Allison set when she was 16 years old have yet to be broken, including the vault of 4.11m in 2005. Allison broke her leg twice, but that didn’t stop her from winning the CIF California State Meet twice and improving her record to 4.14m.</p><h2><span id=Allison_Stokke-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Allison Stokke- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>She is very private about her love life, which is a result of her unwelcome internet popularity — she hasn’t spoken about any guys she may have dated before to the man she is currently engaged to.</p><p>Allison met her other half, Rickie Fowler, during a gathering for famous athletes in 2015. Rickie Fowler is a professional golfer who was invited to the party by a buddy who introduced him to Allison. The two appeared to be interested in each other and went on a date as soon as they both had some spare time. They appear to be a good match because they have been dating ever since, and even more — Rickie got down on one knee in 2017 and asked Allison to marry him, and her response was favorable. While there is no confirmation of their wedding in the public, they are reported to have already exchanged wedding vows, and according to one of the photographs Allison has shared on her Instagram account, they may be parents to twin boys.</p><h2><span id=Allison_Stokke-_Professional_Career>Allison Stokke- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Allison’s images were released to an online website in early 2007, with the comment ‘Pole Vaulting is Sexy, Barely Legal.’ The photographer wanted to prosecute Matt Ufford, the proprietor of the website where the photos were uploaded, but it was too late — the website had been visited by thousands of people, and Allison’s photos were being circulated all over the internet.</p><p>Allison became so popular on the internet that she was covered by some of the most respected US newspapers and magazines, including “The Washington Post,” “Los Angeles Times,” and “The New York Times,” as well as the UK’s “BBC” channel, Australia’s “The Sydney Morning Herald,” and German newspapers “Der Spiegel.” The majority of the media portrayed Allison as a beautiful and successful athlete, while also emphasizing the dangers that the internet may conceal.</p><p>Alisson was unable to control the situation on her own and thus engaged a professional to handle matters on the internet for her. Her father joined the professional, but he was primarily interested in tracking down stalkers and insane people on the internet so he could denounce them to the police. Allison began attending photoshoots as a fitness model, but she was unhappy with her modeling career because she wanted people to praise her for her athletic career, not her looks – as German reporters put it, ‘Allison became a sex symbol against her choice.’</p><h3><span id=Allison8217s_pole_vaulting_career>Allison’s pole vaulting career</span></h3><p>Alisson got an athletic scholarship and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley to study sociology after graduating from high school at the age of 17. She continued her stellar vaulting accomplishments, breaking the freshman record of 4.11m.</p><p>Stokke worked even harder in her second year, breaking her personal record with 4.21m at a competition in Sacramento. She competed in multiple contests but only made it to eighth place — she earned her All-American designation during her final year by finishing eighth in the NCAA Indoor Championships at Texas A&M. (Allison jumped 4.1m).</p><p>Allison improved her personal best to 4.36m after graduating from college, but she wasn’t swimming at her best and didn’t qualify for the London Olympics in 2012.</p><p>Stokke became more focused on her modeling profession after her relative failures in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. She posed for Nike, Athleta, and Uniqlo. She also worked with GoPro in 2015, when they placed a camera on her pole, and the footage was seen more than six million times on YouTube by 2016.</p><p>Allison is still competing in pole vaulting, but she hasn’t had any remarkable results recently.</p><h3><span id=Favorites_and_other_interests>Favorites and other interests</span></h3><p>Alisson is still passionate about pole vaulting and spends most of her free time exercising and preparing for competitions, but she also makes time for some of her other interests and hobbies.</p><p>Allison became interested in golf because her fiancé (or husband) is a professional golfer — he taught her how to play the popular sport, and she can be seen at most of his competitions. Alisson is a frequent traveler who has visited the United States and a few European countries. She usually travels with Rickie, but she also travels alone on occasion. Stokke prefers nature to big towns and crowds, and she especially enjoys waterfalls and mountains. She enjoys paddleboarding but prefers winter over summer because she prefers skiing and snowboarding above all other activities.</p><p>Allison enjoys watching a good movie late at night, and the type depends on her mood — she can watch a romantic comedy or a terrific action movie if she feels like it. “The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and “Johnny English” are two of her favorite films.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Allison is <strong>5ft 7ins (1.7m)</strong> tall with long brown hair and brown eyes, weighs roughly <strong>115lbs (52kgs)</strong>, and has long brown hair and brown eyes.</p><h2><span id=Social_media>Social media</span></h2><p>Allison is quite active on various famous social media platforms because it is very vital for her modeling profession – although she didn’t appreciate her internet fame at first, she has learned to like and use it over the years.</p><p>Allison started her Twitter account in June 2012, and she already has over 48,000 followers and has tweeted over 230 times. Allison’s Instagram account is currently followed by approximately 570,000 people, and she’s added over 190 photos to it — Allison also has a Facebook profile, which has more than 125,000 fans.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Elegy Ellem</a></h3>Elegy Ellem estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
