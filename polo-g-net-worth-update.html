He’s gonna be old enough to see what I’m doing and he’s looking up to me. I have to be the best man that I can be for him.”&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The same day I was supposed to go to college, I ended up hitting the studio and then poppin’ out on the block after that. So, I decided you have to take off as a rapper if you aren’t gonna carry your ass to school.”&nbsp;</p><p>“To the point that I could be in the studio for two or three hours working on the same song just because I want it to be perfect. I don’t want to freestyle anything. I want to write it all out and really figure out what I’m trying to say, so I can get these people to really feel where I’m coming from.”&nbsp;</p><p>“For me to shed light on it and let people know, ‘Yeah, I understand where you’re coming from and I feel the same way, too,’ could make people feel better about their situation. Like, ‘I ain’t the only person who experienced this or that.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6W8rbuMoGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkrqiUlsGme5FsZ3BrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raven-symone-left-the-view-for-disney-channel-but-what-else-has-she-been-up-to-lately.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raven-Symon Left The View For Disney Channel, But What Else Has She Been Up To Lately?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./latrell-sprewell-net-worth-wiki-biography-age-wife-parents-nationality-photos-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Latrell Sprewell Net Worth, Wiki, Biography, Age, Wife, Parents, Nationality, Photos &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./title-alchemist-currensy-continuance-album-review.html>Alchemist &amp;amp; Curren$y | Continuance Album Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dominic-chianese.html>Dominic Chianese Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garrett-myles-bridges-net-worth.html>Garrett Myles Bridges Net Worth How Much is Bridges Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-bivins-net-worth.html>Michael Bivins Net Worth | TheRichest</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html>Michelle Williams' Husbands and Boyfriends Over the Years</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
