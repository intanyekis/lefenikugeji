Police Department first responded to an anonymous call about a possible trespasser at the “Matrix” star’s property around 7 p.m. Wednesday, but found no one there, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">law enforcement sources told TMZ.</a></p><p>Officers headed back around five hours later when an alarm started blaring at 1 a.m. Thursday, the outlet said.</p><p>That time, police spotted multiple men in ski masks on security cameras smashing a window and entering the star’s home, estimated to be worth around $7 million.</p><p>Police said the suspects took one firearm from the home before fleeing, the report said.</p><p>Reeves was not at the home at the time, the sources said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The John Wick star

Reeves’ Hollywood Hills home was reportedly broken into early Thursday. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><p>Detectives are looking at videos from around the home and from neighbors’ security cameras.</p><p>They are specifically looking into the possibility that the first call made Wednesday night was made by someone scoping out the house.</p><p>The Post has reached out to the Los Angeles Police Department and Reeves’ agents for comment.</p><p>This is not the first time Reeves’ home has been broken into — in 2014, he faced two back-to-back intruders.</p><p>One woman in her mid-40s broke into the mansion while the “John Wick” star was sleeping and fell asleep in his library chair, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ reported at the time</a>.</p><figure

allegedly walked into his home through an unlocked door while he was not home.</p><p>She allegedly got naked, jumped in his shower and skinny-dipped in his pool, before the cleaning crew called police, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to TMZ.</a></p><p>Both women were taken into custody and were given psychological evaluations.</p><p>Earlier this year, Reeves and his partner, Alexandra Grant, were also <a href=#>granted a temporary restraining order</a> against a man who claims he is related to the actor.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Reeves’ home was previously broken into twice by two different women in 2014. <span class=credit>Murray Close/Lionsgate</span></figure><p>Bryan Keith Dixon, 38, reportedly trespassed onto the actor’s $5.6 million Hollywood Hills property six times between Nov. 5 and Jan. 20.</p><p>According to court docs seen by the outlet, Dixon attempted to make contact with the “John Wick” star each time.</p><p>It went as far as Reeves having to hire a private security team to investigate the alleged intruder, who has been sharing several posts on social media in which he claims to be the actor’s blood relative.</p><p>In his bizarre social media posts, Dixon called himself “Jasper Keith Reeves” and said he wants to put the actor “in charge” of him, per TMZ.</p><p>He also said he wants to assign his “personal rights” to the actor, the outlet adds.</p><p class=postsid
