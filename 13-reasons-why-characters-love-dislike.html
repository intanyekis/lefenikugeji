She is a strong survivor and she spoke up in a courtroom full of other people, even though it was extremely hard for her to do that.

The biggest mistake that he made was making a list titled “hot or not”. The list objectified girls at his high school and he knew that it was a mean thing to do. He was remorseful.</p><h2 id=we-love-tyler-because-he-s-a-strong-survivor><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>We Love Tyler Because He's A Strong Survivor</span></h2><p class=p1>We love Tyler because just like Jessica, he is another strong survivor.

At the same time, we also don’t like the fact that Hannah decided to end her own life. She decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">end her own life</a> based on temporary circumstances. She acted as if high school was going to be forever. If she waited a few more years until college, she would have realized that life gets so much better after high school.</p><h2 id=we-can-t-stand-seth-because-he-harms-justin><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>We Can't Stand Seth Because He Harms Justin</span></h2><p>We can’t stand Seth because he was always very abusive with Justin.
