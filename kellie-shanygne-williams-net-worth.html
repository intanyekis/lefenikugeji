Her foray into producing has also helped in this regard as she handles both entertainment and charitable productions.</p><h3>Kellie Shanygne Williams Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Kellie started acting after being enrolled in the Howard University Children’s Theater; her father felt that Kellie had trouble expressing and speaking which led to the enrollment. At a very young age, she started modelling and acting, which opportunity would allow her to start doing commercials and eventually land her the first stage role of her career in “Cousins”. She would then do other theatre shows like “The Bacchae”, “Pure Energy” and “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone”, to name a few. These were the start of her net worth.</p><p>After the complete run of the television sitcom “Family Matters”, she went on to her first feature film debut in “Suspect”, a film starring <a href=#>Dennis Quaid</a> and <a href=#>Cher</a>. Kellie then started to do recurring roles in numerous television shows, including “Moesha”, “Girlfriends”, “The Parkers” and “Eve”. She has also starred in shows like “What About Joan” alongside <a href=#>Joan Cusack</a> and a few episodes of “Clean House” as a substitute host for <a href=#>Niecy Nash</a>.</p><p>Kellie is also the co-executive producer of the film “Blessed and Cursed” which was released in 2010, which also added to her net worth.</p><p>A few of her recent appearances include her role as Cee Cee in “Steppin: The Movie” and “Celebrity Wife Swap”, a show in which she traded lives with <a href=#>Ce Ce Peniston</a>. A lot of these projects have helped her to accumulate her current fortune.</p><p>Kellie also manages a rhythm and blues group called Amari, which is composed of women Kellie grew up with.</p><p>Kellie dedicates a lot of her time to charity work, being involved in numerous programs like “The Starlight Foundation International Youth Ambassador”, “Great Beginning for Black Babies”, “Famous Phone Friends”, and “Hollywood for Children”. She is the creator of the “Kellie Williams Program”, which aims to provide 14-20 year olds with the opportunity to produce their own television show; the program airs on Comcast Cable Local On-Demand. Her dedication to education and philanthropy has earned her two awards, the “Timmie” Award from the Touchdown Club of Washington D.C. which she received in 1994 as well as the “1995 Role Model of the Year Excellence Award” from RJR Nabisco Company.</p><p>Kellie Shanygne Williams is also known as Kellie Shanygne Jackson, after her marriage to Hannibal Jackson in 2009.
